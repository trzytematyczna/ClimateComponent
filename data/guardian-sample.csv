The latest theatrical House 'Science' committee hearing | Dana Nuccitelli,Dana Nuccitelli: Republican Party leaders keep putting fossil fuel industry profits over the well-being of Americans,"Last week, the House “Science” committee held one of its regular hearings to dispute the validity of climate science research. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) articulated the purpose of the hearing when speaking at a recent Heartland Institute climate science denial conference:
Next week we’re going to have a hearing on our favorite subject of climate change and also on the scientific method, which has been repeatedly ignored by the so-called self-professed climate scientists
For that, Smith was rightly called out by Jeffrey Mervis at Science magazine:
the chairman of the science committee in the U.S. House of Representatives acknowledged that the committee is now a tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community.
Climate scientist Michael Mann was one of the witnesses testifying in last week’s hearing. In the event’s defining exchange, Mann quoted The Princess Bride, and then proceeded to quote Mervis’ condemnation of Lamar Smith:
Smith responded by asserting “that is not known as an objective writer or magazine,” to which the scientific community collectively gasped in horror. This is the magazine associated with Science which, along with Nature, are the two most highly-respected peer-reviewed scientific journals in the world. Mervis has been writing about science policy for Science magazine for 24 years. Lamar Smith, on the other hand is a contributor to Breitbart, entered a Wall Street Journal op-ed into the congressional record, and said this shortly after President Trump’s inauguration:
Unfortunately, as is usually the case in these hearings, despite being presented with the opportunity to learn from climate experts, most of the committee members seemed more interested in expressing their beliefs, however uninformed they might be.
At the 2:04:05 mark in the hearing video, Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL) provided a perfect example of this behavior. He began by asking witness Judith Curry what causes ice ages (Milankovich cycles, which we’ve known for nearly 100 years), so that he could make the point that natural factors caused past climate changes – a point that usually leads to a common logical fallacy (presented here in cartoon form).
Webster proceeded to claim it was “the standard belief of most scientists” in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an ice age. This is another long-debunked myth; in reality, most climate scientists in the 1970s were predicting impending global warming. 
However, some scientists had projected that if the amount of sulfur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere were to quadruple, that would block enough sunlight to cause dramatic cooling. But since that pollution was also causing acid rain, governments developed regulations like the Clean Air Act, and sulfur levels soon declined. 
The scientists’ projection wasn’t wrong; rather, the scenario didn’t happen because we took action to prevent it, much like if we take sufficient action to cut carbon pollution, we can prevent dangerous global warming. But Rep. Webster spent most of his allotted time expressing his ideologically-convenient beliefs about how clueless climate scientists are, rather than learning from the experts sitting in front of him. Dr. Mann could easily have explained this myth, but wasn’t given the opportunity.
Curry spent most of her time exaggerating climate uncertainties, as she has done for years. In his first question to the witnesses, Lamar Smith made it clear that’s why she was invited (emphasis added):
 What are the uncertainties, complexities, biases involved with climate science or the study of climate science that need to be considered before we can actually make informed decisions about what to do about climate science? 
To be clear, it’s been decades since we’ve known enough about climate science to understand the need to take action to mitigate its risks. In fact, greater uncertainty translates into greater urgency. When driving a car on a foggy night, slowing down is the wise response to impaired vision; putting the pedal to the metal because of uncertainty as to whether there’s a brick wall ahead would be stupid.
In fact, as Mann explained at the 1:09:36 mark in the video, many climate impacts are happening faster than expected. The brick wall is coming into view. Even one of the Republicans’ own witnesses, Roger Pielke Jr. argued at the 1:57:05 mark for Congress to act:
My view – which may not be popular among anyone here – is that scientific uncertainty is not going to be eliminated on this topic before we have to act ... you guys might think about a low carbon tax
Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) half-jokingly called this “blasphemy.” There was also a consensus among the witnesses that the Trump administration’s proposed slashing of climate research funding would be damaging and counter-productive. If Republicans want to argue that we don’t know enough to take action on climate change, cutting research funding would be grossly hypocritical. That’s like turning off the headlights and putting on sunglasses.
Speaking of consensus, Mann was the only witness who accurately represented the conclusions of 97% of climate science research – a point that was frequently raised during the hearing. Fellow witness John Christy, for example, is among the less than 3% of publishing climate scientists who minimize human-caused global warming. His testimony focused on wrongly claiming that climate models have been falsified, using a flawed, debunked graph.
Eventually, Lamar Smith claimed “there is no consensus; the 97% was derived from a small sample of a small sample.” My colleagues and I have a new paper addressing this claim that will be soon be published, so we’ll return to this myth within the next few weeks.
There was one particularly McCarthyesque exchange at the 1:28:50 mark in which Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) inquired:
 Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an association called the Union of Concerned Scientists?
Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an organization called the Climate Accountability Institute? 
This brought to mind a scene from The American President:
Higgins’ concern is that members of the Climate Accountability Institute have suggested that if documents reveal that ExxonMobil knew of the threats its product poses (they did – we now know Exxon knew), like the tobacco industry, the company could be sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. 
Rep. Higgins doesn’t like this idea and confronted Mann, who is a scientific advisor to many climate organizations, including the Climate Accountability Institute. However, 17 state attorneys general have already formed a coalition to investigate ExxonMobil’s activities and determine if it’s guilty of fraud, so it’s difficult to understand why Higgins would attack Dr. Mann about this in what was supposed to be a scientific hearing.
Unfortunately, last week’s hearing confirmed that far too many Republican Party leaders are more interested in protecting the profits of big oil and coal companies than preserving a livable climate for future generations.",1113,1.9047619047619048e-4,1.9047619047619048e-4,0.005904761904761905,0.017333333333333333,0.011619047619047619,0.6173333333333334,1.9047619047619048e-4,1.9047619047619048e-4,0.2554285714285714,0.09161904761904763,2017-04-04

Donald Trump’s election left the many in the United States reeling. In particular his success has left women, people of colour and those with disabilities feeling more vulnerable than ever. The land of the free seems a lot less free than before.
Americans aren’t the only ones who fear a Trump presidency. His win reinforced a right-wing populism that is resurgent across the western world, but also threatens to slow down the global movement against climate change. Not only does the president-elect not believe that climate change is man-made, but his cabinet level appointments show an utter disregard for our environment.
For every attempt to extract fossil fuels from the ground, there are people dedicated to keep them where they should be
An astounding nine members of his top team deny even basic climate science – with his secretary of state (who is in charge of international climate policy), Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil. Trump’s policy proposals – to end the moratorium on coal mining, to support new fossil fuel infrastructure and to scrap Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan – are exceptionally reckless. There’s a reason that the outgoing president poured half billion dollars into the Green Climate Fund this week. It’s because he knows that Trump is planning to end such payments and that global action on climate change is under threat.
The boost for climate change deniers has distinct parallels here in Britain. The leave side of the EU campaign was first registered in the same building as Lord Lawson’s climate-sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation (and Lawson chaired the Vote Leave campaign). Many politicians who were prominent in the Brexit campaign – such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage – are known to have been climate change sceptics. We’re in danger of such concerns being painted as some sort of metropolitan preoccupation, rather than the very real threat it poses to all of our livelihoods.
Clearly, Trump’s election poses a threat to the climate movement but, worrying as it is, it is neutralised to some extent by its global nature: from the First Nations communities blocking the Keystone pipeline, to the energy co-operatives springing up across the world and the anti-fracking campaigns here in Britain.
For every attempt to extract fossil fuels from the ground, there are people dedicated to keep them where they should be. The economics is also stacked against climate change deniers. Renewables are competing with and beating fossil fuels when it comes to cost. Huge investment in China has seen the country installing enough solar panels to cover three football pitches for every hour of 2016, thus forcing prices down even further. Additionally – and looking specifically at the situation in the US – Trump’s damaging plans will be curtailed in a federal system where many key Republican states have thriving low-carbon economies and will resist attempts to cut funding.
Like many of those reading this, I am truly worried about the effects of Trumpism, but I am hopeful that the politics of hate will be overcome. That’s why tomorrow I will be joining one of the more than one hundred Bridges Not Walls actions taking place across the world – bringing together people who reject the idea that the future of our world is owned by a gold-plated billionaire.
It’s why I’m working with climate campaigners to urge Britain to step up and fill any void left by the US by becoming a world leader on renewables and storage.
There is no turning back time on the US elections, and tomorrow Trump will become president, but that does not leave us powerless – indeed his swearing-in should be a call to action, not a time to shrink away.",636,3.53356890459364e-4,0.16996466431095406,3.53356890459364e-4,3.53356890459364e-4,3.53356890459364e-4,3.53356890459364e-4,0.14169611307420496,0.09929328621908128,0.3572438162544169,0.2300353356890459,2017-01-19
5cc19337a2c3615169989fbf,article,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/20/apple-green-bond-environment-energy-toyota-climate-change,Alison Moodie,1,Guardian Sustainable Business,"Guardian sustainable business, Apple, Energy, Environment, Climate change, Business, Energy industry, Energy efficiency",8,1458447569000,0,71,Can Apple's $1.5bn green bond inspire more environmental investments?,Apple’s willingness to borrow billions to address the economic impact of climate change could pave the way for other businesses to do the same,"On the surface, green bonds seem counter intuitive: why would a company willingly take on debt to finance environmental efforts? But Apple’s recent decision to issue its first green bond suggests that this type of investment could play a key role in reining in global warming.
Apple’s $1.5bn green bond, announced last month, will fund several initiatives, including the company’s conversion to 100% renewable energy, installation of more energy efficient heating and cooling systems and an increase in the company’s use of biodegradable materials. A green bond, like a typical bond, is simply a way to borrow money, but it’s issued specifically to fund environmental projects. 
Apple’s green bond reflects a growing corporate concern about the economic impact of climate change. Businesses are responsible for the majority of manmade greenhouse gas emissions, which are driving up average temperatures worldwide and affecting many companies’ bottom lines. Some, including Apple, are realizing the need to invest in environmental resources, such as watersheds or forests, to protect the sources of their products.
Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters that the company decided to issue its green bond after December’s UN Climate Summit in Paris, during which hundreds of companies pledged to fight climate change. With its bond sale, Apple has become the largest US company to have issued a green bond – although Toyota still holds the crown for the largest corporate green bond ever offered in the US with its $1.75bn green bond issued in 2014.
The green bond market is still in its infancy. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, a UK nonprofit that tracks the market, the first green bond was issued in 2007, and the first corporate issuance didn’t come along until 2013. Since then, a handful of high profile companies have jumped on the bandwagon, including EDF, a French power company, and Bank of America, which used the proceeds to loan money to cities and other businesses for installing solar panels, wind turbines and LED lighting.
For global companies, changing operations to deal with the impact of climate change requires a lot of time and money. As a result, many companies have traditionally been unwilling to invest in renewable energy or other climate projects without a significant return on investment. For example, Apple will need to raise billions of dollars to achieve its ambitious plans to reduce its environmental impact. Last year, it committed to spend $848m over 25 years to buy enough solar-generated electricity to offset all the electricity used in its corporate and retail operations in California.
While green bonds have commonly been used to fund renewable energy projects, an increasing amount of money is going to projects that help offices and other buildings use water and other energy more efficiently, said Andrew Whiley, a spokesman for Climate Bonds Initiative. Electric cars and low-carbon transportation also are becoming popular, he added. 
Globally, the green bond market is expected to keep growing. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, the market, including government-issued bonds, reached an all-time high of $41.8bn in 2015, up from $36.6bn in 2014 and $11bn in 2013. Financial services company HSBC predicts between $55bn and $80bn worth of green bonds will be issued around the world in 2016, while the Climate Bonds Initiative believes sales will exceed $100bn.
Toyota’s green bonds demonstrate a growing investor interest in transportation in particular. The company has issued two green bonds totaling $3bn since 2014, and has used the money to fund leases and loans for its fuel efficient cars, which it defines as those that get 35 miles per gallon or use hybrid engines.
Clinton Moloney, sustainability advisory leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that as the effects of climate change become more devastating and widespread, green bond projects could grow more complex. For instance, proceeds can be used to build a seawall to help protect the San Francisco Bay from rising sea levels, or to restore marshlands that help to soak up runoffs during a big storm.
“We can do environmental projects that use concrete and steel, or we can think of nature based solutions as well,” Moloney said. “Evaluating those projects needs to be more sophisticated. That’s where we’re headed.”
Another issue facing green bonds is transparency. For investors who aren’t only interested in making money, figuring out the environmental impact of their investments while ensuring that the money is spent as promised can be difficult to accomplish. As a result, a number of organizations have come up with rules and metrics to help both corporate borrowers and investors track and understand how the money is spent.
One such effort comes from the International Market Association, which has worked with investment banks or other investment firms such as JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and World Bank to create a set of guidelines called the Green Bond Principles. The guidelines define the types of environmental benefits that could be covered by a green bond, such as reducing pollution or conserving wildlife. They also recommend an annual reporting by the bond issuers on how they use the proceeds.
“The more confidence investors can feel in the green bona fides of a project, the better the marketplace will operate,” said PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Moloney.
For its part, Toyota is communicating directly with investors to keep its green bonds transparent. To show investors that the money from its green loans is being spent properly, it publishes a monthly report to show the amount spent on financing leases and loans for qualifying models, such as the Prius.
“Investors were able to see how the funds were being deployed and make their own determination, [and] whether it was consistent with what we had promised,” said Adam Stam, national manager of secured funding at Toyota Financial Services.",941,0.03540372670807454,0.16583850931677016,0.6710144927536232,0.02091097308488613,2.0703933747412008e-4,0.0022774327122153212,0.04575569358178054,2.0703933747412008e-4,0.05196687370600414,0.006418219461697723,2016-03-20

The group, called Extinction Rebellion, is today backed by almost 100 senior academics from across the UK, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.
In a letter published in the Guardian they say the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means “the ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.”
Those behind Extinction Rebellion say almost 500 people have signed up to be arrested and that they plan to bring large sections of London to a standstill next month in a campaign of peaceful mass civil disobedience – culminating with a sit-in protest in Parliament Square on 17 November.
Roger Hallam, one of the founders of the campaign, said it was calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war.
On top of the specific demands, Hallam said he hoped the campaign of “respectful disruption” would change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster.
“The planet is in ecological crisis – we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event this planet has experienced,” he said. “Children alive today in the UK will face the terrible consequences of inaction, from floods to wildfires, extreme weather to crop failures and the inevitable breakdown of society. We have a duty to act.”
Extinction Rebellion is part of the Rising Up activist group, and organisers have spent the past few months holding public meetings in towns and cities across the country.
Hundreds of people have gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the unfolding climate emergency – and what they can do about it.
“It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing,” said Hallam, an academic at King’s College who specialises in social change and protest. He said the group was now getting 20 requests a week from people across the UK wanting to be given the talk.
“To put it simply,” he said, “we’re fucked. From the melting ice in the Arctic to the release of methane from the permafrost, the evidence is overwhelming and people are starting to realise that. What we need now is to start working out what we are going to do about it.”
The attempt to organise wide-scale civil disobedience around the looming climate breakdown comes just weeks after three people were jailed – and then released – for anti-fracking campaigns in the UK. And it follows dire warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster.
Almost 100 academics – half of them professors – on Friday backed the call for rebellion.
In a letter to the Guardian they state: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.”
Last week the US politician Bernie Sanders posted a link to an article supporting Extinction Rebellion, civil disobedience and the wider anti-fracking campaign to his 7.5 million followers. Hallam said the group was in talks with campaigners in the US about organising similar Extinction Rebellion events in Washington DC next month.
Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, is also supporting the plan and will be among the speakers at the launch in parliament next week.
As part of their attempt to mobilise the wider environmental movement, activists from Extinction Rebellion, armed with flowers and letters, occupied Greenpeace headquarters last week. Describing the move as a “tap on the shoulder of a friend”, they wanted the environmental organisation to email its members highlighting the rebellion plan – and ideally calling on them to take part.
After two hours of “friendly discussions” the group left. Greenpeace subsequently said that although it supports any attempt to raise awareness of the climate emergency it does not know enough about those behind Extinction Rebellion to ask its members to take part.
But Hallam remains undeterred. The planned rebellion will begin with a declaration of demands being pinned to parliament next week and reach its peak with a peaceful sit-down protest in Parliament Square on 17 November. “After that, who knows,” he added.
At the end of another organising meeting in a cafe on a west London estate this week, Hallam acknowledged it is impossible to say exactly what will happen. How many of those who have signed up will actually turn up on the day? Will those who say they are prepared to get arrested and go to prison buckle when faced with police telling them to move? Will hundreds more supporters turn up unannounced?
Looking around the bustling cafe, where about half of the 30 people in attendance are signing up to take part, Hallam said: “In the end we have to realise that we will all be alone on our deathbed and asking ourselves whether we lived a worthwhile life – and for this generation the climate crisis is the overriding existential challenge. There are no guarantees but doing nothing, not trying, is not an option.”
Gail Bradbrook, scientist and veteran of tax justice campaigns and the Occupy movement
“For years I have engaged with this ecological crisis on an intellectual level, the mounting evidence, the science … but now I have engaged with the potential destruction of this world on an emotional level and there is a fundamental difference. There is huge feeling of grief, of loss. I found myself bursting into tears, of feeling distant with longstanding friends … but as with other forms of grief, as the poets say, you start to come through that initial shock and feeling of loss and there is a renewed appreciation of the beauty of the world, a renewed realisation that we are connected.
Once you face and feel the shock of what we are facing, if you are willing to face the grief and can process those feelings, there is tremendous energy and a will to do what it takes. So that is what we have been asking people, to be willing to look at the truth of our predicament and grieve.
And something is starting to change. There is a still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen. But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, both breaking from their institutions and breaking from their individual lives.
For me it goes beyond the idea of protecting my life as a privileged individual, or even the idea of protecting my children’s future to a deeper need to have been a good ancestor to future generations, to know that I did my best when the big challenge came.”
Alison Green, pro vice-chancellor of Arden University and UK director of the Scientists Warning public engagement campaign (speaking in a personal capacity)
“I have no formal background in environmental issues and am fairly senior in my organisation. But unlike some academics I have taken the time to look properly at the evidence and have come to the clear conclusion that we are facing an imminent and potentially catastrophic climate emergency.
It has led me to re-evaluate what I am doing and why I am doing it. I am a career academic but in the face of what is likely about to happen to us I have to reconsider my priorities. I have children and I feel incredibly conflicted continuing in a ‘business as usual’ national setting, getting up and going to work when just around the corner there is a future for my children that is not the kind of future they believe they are working towards. If I am honest, it really breaks my heart. I have to ask myself, can I continue to do with integrity what I am doing when I know what is about to happen?
I am therefore asking myself, am I prepared to protest? Am I prepared to go to jail? And these are questions I am hoping many more people start to engage with. There will not be an opportunity for a ‘lessons learned’ scenario if we don’t act or if we get this wrong – there will not be an opportunity to repent at leisure.
If you understand the science, and I would put myself in that category, then I think there is an obligation to act – we are entitled to rebel because our interests are not being met. My levels of optimism are not high and this may not work but we must have the courage to try.”
Jessica Townsend, writer
“I’m writing a novel set in 2030 and as I started the research on climate change, I became more and more alarmed at the disconnect between what I was reading in popular science books and what is in the mainstream media.
Much of it made me feel traumatised and upset. I don’t understand how we have allowed living animals to be part of a factory process or to treat the Earth as if it was just raw materials for our industries.
Technology has made the world so complicated that regular people don’t have time to keep abreast of everything that’s happening. But the ecological disaster quietly unfolding around us is just too important to ignore: we have to wake up.
The last campaign I was involved in was Stop the War and I was so gutted when Tony Blair invaded Iraq that I swore I’d never do this again. But I’m a grandmother. If we do nothing we are heading for 3-4C of global warming. That will mean a superheated world, with perhaps a billion migrants, and societal breakdown. My grandson, everyone’s grandchildren, deserve a better future than that.”
Rupert Read, academic at the University of East Anglia and Green party politician
“I’ve taken part in civil disobedience before but not for the last 15 years. I’ve been prompted to again by the dire stakes of the climate breakdown we are now in the early throes of, and by the dire failure of our government (or any government, for that matter) to take these stakes seriously.
The way that climate chaos has manifested in the last three years, with our weather systems perhaps beginning to spiral out of control, and especially the overheating of the Arctic, has been a big factor for me. The situation in the Arctic is now genuinely terrifying, because of the risk of huge-scale methane release.
This is an emergency, an unprecedented emergency. It dwarfs any other emergency we’ve known, including even World War II. And we will be judged by our children by how we respond in this emergency. Not by what are, in comparison, just distractions: such as Brexit. To future generations I would say that we are trying. Those of us who are joining this rebellion, and the many who support us, are really trying. If we fail you, it wasn’t for lack of effort.”",1955,0.04089171974522293,1.2738853503184715e-4,1.2738853503184715e-4,1.2738853503184715e-4,1.2738853503184715e-4,0.0421656050955414,0.058726114649681534,0.49439490445859874,0.03579617834394905,0.32751592356687903,2018-10-26

However, the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that denies the need to tackle climate change. Therefore, for several years any hope of passing climate legislation hinged upon breaking through the near-universal opposition among Republican legislators. A number of groups have focused on doing just that.
In the wake of the 2016 US election results, I contacted these groups to assess their feelings about the prospects of US government action on climate change in the near future. The general sentiment was understandably one of discouraged pessimism, but each group identified glimmers of hope.
Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) is one of the leading grassroots climate organizations in America, and has also expanded rapidly internationally. The group has seen explosive growth in recent years, now hosting chapters in 356 of America’s 435 congressional districts (over 80%), with a membership approaching 50,000 strong.
Under the CCL proposal, carbon pollution is taxed at the source, and 100% of the revenue is returned to taxpayers via a regular rebate check. It’s a bipartisan solution – liberals get their desired carbon pollution tax, while conservatives get a free market policy that doesn’t grow the size of government. Moreover, modeling projects that the policy will have a net overall positive effect on the economy.
Citizens’ Climate Lobby has also achieved several significant successes. The group was involved in spearheading the Gibson Resolution, in which 15 Republican members of Congress called for action to tackle the risks posed by climate change. CCL was also the driving force behind the creation of the House Climate Solutions Caucus – a group currently comprised of 10 Republican and 10 Democratic members of Congress exploring bipartisan climate policy solutions. And CCL initiated the California state government’s Resolution urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax.
According to CCL Executive Director Mark Reynolds, the 2016 election didn’t change group’s strategy. As Reynolds told me, because Democrats are already on board with climate policy:
Our path to legislation has always gone through the Republican Party.
As an organization with a long history of working with Republicans on climate policy, now that the Republican Party controls US government, CCL is now more relevant and important than ever. Reynolds told me that since the election results, traffic to CCL’s website has increased eightfold, and attendance of its weekly introductory calls has spiked from an average of about 20 to 200 last week. The majority of Americas who are unhappy with the election results have become galvanized, which bodes well for grassroots support of climate solutions.
Reynolds also sees an opportunity for Republicans to take control of the climate issue after many liberals rallied against a revenue-neutral carbon tax proposal in the state of Washington. This opens up a window for the Republican Party to take ownership of one of the best policies to tackle climate change. As Donald Trump might put it, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is “a great deal” because it efficiently addresses the problem while boosting the economy, and the rebate protects American wallets from rising energy prices.
The Republican Party has thus far opposed all climate policies in Congress, but the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate carbon pollution, and it began doing so under President Obama. Some have proposed that the easiest way for the GOP to eliminate those government climate regulations – which party leaders abhor, but most Republican voters support – would be to replace them with free market legislation.
For example the Niskanen Center is a free market think tank that supports this type of policy, and has proposed swapping EPA regulations for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The group’s president Jerry Taylor wrote a detailed post about the prospects of a carbon tax under the incoming Republican leadership, which is well worth reading. Taylor thinks that Republican leaders are now less likely to propose a climate tax than prior to the election for several reasons.
First, they will likely devote the next several years to delaying, weakening, and/or eliminating the EPA regulations, rather than replacing them. Because of the Supreme Court decision, eliminating the regulations will be difficult, but since Trump will appoint at least one justice to the court, it may not fully survive legal challenges. However, if it does survive, the next president could fully restore the EPA regulations if Congress declines to replace them with legislation. While this offers a glimmer of hope that the GOP could pass a climate bill, it’s doubtful that party leaders will be so forward-thinking.
Second, the election results made it clear that climate denial will not hurt most Republican politicians in elections. Third, while many Republican members of Congress privately accept the reality of climate change and the need to address it, and Niskanen has identified several who would be willing to introduce climate legislation if the opportunity were to present itself, Taylor believes the election results make such a political opportunity less likely.
The R Street Institute is a free market think tank that has likewise made the conservative case for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The group’s president Eli Lehrer believes the chances of carbon tax legislation would have been low regardless of the election outcome. As he told me:
A carbon tax would be a possibility in the context of broad tax reform and if such reform moves forward as it may, I suppose there is some chance it could be part of a package … A carbon tax per se is not highly likely and is not something we plan to push ourselves right now but it is not impossible either. 
R Street Energy Policy Director Catrina Rorke elaborated where she sees opportunities in cutting carbon pollution under the incoming government:
We’re focused on streamlining regulatory barriers to entry to electricity markets, an obstacle that plagues emerging and advanced technologies with characteristics quite different from their predecessors. We also think we can make major strides in updating the way the federal regulatory machine works, given that the underlying legislation is outdated and insufficiently flexible ... If politics is the art of the possible, we’re really going to see some interesting things happen -- for governance and for the climate.
These groups were generally pessimistic about the prospects of a climate bill coming from the next Congress, but they did spot glimmers of hope, and the future isn’t set in stone. In its 2016 Congressional lobbying effort, CCL reported that Republican members of Congress were 10 times more likely to be receptive to the group’s message than to be hostile, up from a 3-to-1 ratio just two years ago. Many GOP policymakers recognize the threats posed by climate change, at least in private. As Jerry Taylor noted, they just need the political opportunity for climate legislation to present itself.
That political opportunity would require something to change – for Republican climate leadership to be rewarded rather than punished. It’s difficult to envision that change happening in the next few years, but not impossible. Groups like CCL will continue working behind the scenes to help make it happen. In the meantime, the R Street Institute foresees other opportunities to chip away at US carbon pollution levels.
It’s not an encouraging landscape for protecting future generations from a climate catastrophe, but at least there’s hope. And if the GOP crushes that hope over the next four years, it seems likely that the Democratic Party will have a good chance to restore it in 2020.",1244,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.16770293609671846,0.01226252158894646,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.06580310880829016,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.024352331606217616,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.6132987910189983,0.1158894645941278,2016-11-21

The US and Australia are only slightly behind with both pushing the global temperature rise dangerously over 4C above pre-industrial levels says the paper, while even the EU, which is usually seen as a climate leader, is on course to more than double the 1.5C that scientists say is a moderately safe level of heating.
The study, published on Friday in the journal Nature Communications, assesses the relationship between each nation’s ambition to cut emissions and the temperature rise that would result if the world followed their example.
The aim of the paper is to inform climate negotiators as they begin a two-year process of ratcheting up climate commitments, which currently fall far short of the 1.5-to-2C goal set in France three years ago.
The related website also serves as a guide to how nations are sharing the burden of responding to the greatest environmental threat humankind has ever faced.
Among the major economies, the study shows India is leading the way with a target that is only slightly off course for 2C. Less developed countries are generally more ambitious, in part because they have fewer factories, power plants and cars, which means they have lower emissions to rein in.
On the opposite side of the spectrum are the industrial powerhouse China and major energy exporters who are doing almost nothing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. These include Saudi Arabia (oil), Russia (gas) and Canada, which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands. Fossil fuel lobbies in these countries are so powerful that government climate pledges are very weak, setting the world on course for more than 5C of heating by the end of the century.
Only slightly better are the group of countries that are pushing the planet beyond 4C. Among them are the US, which has huge emissions from energy, industry and agriculture somewhat offset by promises of modest cuts and more renewables. Australia, which remains heavily dependent on coal exports, is also in this category.
The wealthy shopping societies of Europe fare slightly better – largely because emissions on products are calculated at the source of manufacture rather than the point of consumption – but the authors of the paper say their actions lag behind their promises to set a positive example.
“It is interesting is to see how far out some countries are, even those that are considered leaders in the climate mitigation narrative,” said the study’s author, Yann Robiou du Pont of Melbourne University.
The study is likely to be controversial. Under the Paris agreement, there is no top-down consensus on what is a fair share of responsibility. Instead each nation sets its own bottom-up targets according to a number of different factors, including political will, level of industrialisation, ability to pay, population size, historical responsibility for emissions. Almost every government, the authors say, selects an interpretation of equity that serves their own interests and allows them to achieve a relative gain on other nations.
To get around these differing concepts of fairness, the paper assesses each nation by the least stringent standards they set themselves and then extrapolates this to the world. In doing so, the authors say they can “operationalise disagreements”.
Taking account of the different interpretations, they say the world needs to commit to a virtual 1.4C target in order to achieve a 2C goal. They hope their equity metric can be used in next month’s UN climate talks in Katowice and in climate litigation cases.
The authors said the study could in future be extended to the subnational level, such as individual US states. They also note that a few key sectors are currently omitted, including land-use change (which is fundamental in rapidly deforesting nations such as Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia), international shipping and aviation.
Although the study highlights the huge gap between political will and scientific alarm, Robiou du Pont said it should inspire rather than dispirit people.
“The positive outcome of this study is that we have a metric to assess the ratcheting up of ambition. Civil society, experts and decision-makers can use this to hold their governments accountable, and possibly undertake climate litigation cases as happened recently in the Netherlands,” he said. “This metric translates the lack of ambition on a global scale to a national scale. If we look at the goal of trying to avoid damage to the Earth, then I am pessimistic as this is already happening. But this should be a motivation to ratchet up ambition and avoid global warming as much and as rapidly as possible. Every fraction of a degree will have a big impact.”
Commenting on the study, other academics said it could be used by anyone to show how climate action can be navigated in a world in which each country ranks itself based on what they consider to be fair.
“This paper provides a means for countries to check how their contribution might be perceived by other countries and thus judge whether they are perceived as a climate leader or laggard,” said Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London.",860,2.638522427440633e-4,0.22189973614775724,0.047757255936675465,2.638522427440633e-4,0.013456464379947228,0.2773087071240105,0.4382585751978892,2.638522427440633e-4,2.638522427440633e-4,2.638522427440633e-4,2018-11-16

The industry has long argued that it can considerably reduce carbon emissions by increasing efficiency and reducing waste, but academics are challenging industry assumptions. A new paper, due to be published by US researchers later this month, will forecast that information and communications technology could create up to 3.5% of global emissions by 2020 – surpassing aviation and shipping – and up to 14% 2040, around the same proportion as the US today.
Global computing power demand from internet-connected devices, high resolution video streaming, emails, surveillance cameras and a new generation of smart TVs is increasing 20% a year, consuming roughly 3-5% of the world’s electricity in 2015, says Swedish researcher Anders Andrae.
In an update to a 2016 peer-reviewed study, Andrae found that without dramatic increases in efficiency, the ICT industry could use 20% of all electricity and emit up to 5.5% of the world’s carbon emissions by 2025. This would be more than any country except the US, China and India.
He expects industry power demand to increase from 200-300 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year now, to 1,200 or even 3,000TWh by 2025. Data centres on their own could produce 1.9 gigatonnes (Gt) (or 3.2% of the global total) of carbon emissions, he says.
“The situation is alarming,” said Andrae, who works for the Chinese communications technology firm Huawei. “We have a tsunami of data approaching. Everything which can be is being digitalised. It is a perfect storm. 5G [the fifth generation of mobile technology] is coming, IP [internet protocol] traffic is much higher than estimated, and all cars and machines, robots and artificial intelligence are being digitalised, producing huge amounts of data which is stored in data centres.”
US researchers expect power consumption to triple in the next five years as one billion more people come online in developing countries, and the “internet of things” (IoT), driverless cars, robots, video surveillance and artificial intelligence grows exponentially in rich countries.
“There will be 8.4bn connected things in 2017, setting the stage for 20.4bn internet of things devices to be deployed by 2020,” says the leading internet analyst firm Gartner.
The industry has encouraged the idea that the digital transformation of economies and large-scale energy efficiencies will slash global emissions by 20% or more, but the scale and speed of the revolution has been a surprise.
Global internet traffic will increase nearly threefold in the next five years says the latest Cisco Visual Networking Index, a leading industry tracker of internet use.
“More than one billion new internet users are expected, growing from three billion in 2015 to 4.1bn by 2020. Over the next five years global IP networks will support up to 10bn new devices and connections, increasing from 16.3bn in 2015 to 26bn by 2020,” says Cisco.
A 2016 Berkeley laboratory report for the US government estimated the country’s data centres, which held about 350m terabytes of data in 2015, could together need over 100TWh of electricity a year by 2020. This is the equivalent of about 10 large nuclear power stations.
Data centre capacity is also rocketing in Europe and Asia with London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam expected to add nearly 200MW of consumption in 2017, or the power equivalent of a medium size power station.
“We are seeing massive growth of data centres in all regions. Trends that started in the US are now standard in Europe. Asia is taking off massively,” says Mitual Patel, head of EMEA data centre research at global investment firm CBRE.
“The volume of data being handled by such centres is growing at unprecedented rates. They are seen as a key element in the next stage of growth for the ICT industry”, says Peter Corcoran, a researcher at the university of Ireland, Galway.
Using renewable energy sounds good but no one else benefits from what will be generated, and it skews national attempts to reduce emissions
Ireland, which with Denmark is becoming a data base for the world’s biggest tech companies, has 350MW connected to data centres but this is expected to triple to over 1,000MW, or the equivalent of a nuclear power station size plant, in the next five years.
Permission has been given for a further 550MW to be connected and 750MW more is in the pipeline, says Eirgrid, the country’s main grid operator.
“If all enquiries connect, the data centre load could account for 20% of Ireland’s peak demand,” says Eirgrid in its All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2017-2026 report.
The data will be stored in vast new one million square feet or larger “hyper-scale” server farms, which companies are now building. The scale of these farms is huge; a single $1bn Apple data centre planned for Athenry in Co Galway, expects to eventually use 300MW of electricity, or over 8% of the national capacity and more than the daily entire usage of Dublin. It will require 144 large diesel generators as back up for when the wind does not blow.
Pressed by Greenpeace and other environment groups, large tech companies with a public face , including Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel and Amazon, have promised to use renewable energy to power data centres. In most cases they are buying it off grid but some are planning to build solar and wind farms close to their centres.
Greenpeace IT analyst Gary Cook says only about 20% of the electricity used in the world’s data centres is so far renewable, with 80% of the power still coming from fossil fuels.
“The good news is that some companies have certainly embraced their responsibility, and are moving quite aggressively to meet their rapid growth with renewable energy. Others are just growing aggressively,” he says.
Architect David Hughes, who has challenged Apple’s new centre in Ireland, says the government should not be taken in by the promises.
“Using renewable energy sounds good but no one else benefits from what will be generated, and it skews national attempts to reduce emissions. Data centres … have eaten into any progress we made to achieving Ireland’s 40% carbon emissions reduction target. They are just adding to demand and reducing our percentage. They are getting a free ride at the Irish citizens’ expense,” says Hughes.
Eirgrid estimates indicate that by 2025, one in every 3kWh generated in Ireland could be going to a data centre, he added. “We have sleepwalked our way into a 10% increase in electricity consumption.”
Fossil fuel plants may have to be kept open longer to power other parts of the country and the costs will fall on the consumer, he says. “We will have to upgrade our grid and build more power generation both wind and backup generation for when the wind isn’t there and this all goes onto people’s bills.”
Under a best case scenario, says Andrae, there will be massive continuous improvements of power saving, renewable energy will become the norm and the explosive growth in demand for data will slow.
But equally, he says, demand could continue to rise dramatically if the industry keeps growing at 20% a year, driverless cars each with dozens of embedded sensors, and cypto-currencies like Bitcoin which need vast amounts of computer power become mainstream.
“There is a real risk that it all gets out of control. Policy makers need to keep a close eye on this,” says Andrae.",1230,0.01650326797385621,0.6733660130718955,0.12598039215686274,0.005065359477124183,1.6339869281045753e-4,0.07859477124183006,1.6339869281045753e-4,1.6339869281045753e-4,1.6339869281045753e-4,0.09983660130718955,2017-12-11

But scientist are still in the dark about who will lose their jobs; no specific scientists or programs were identified.
On Thursday Marshall sent an email announcing that 350 jobs would be lost from the CSIRO as the organisation moved away from studying how climate changes, and towards ways of mitigating or adapting to climate change.
A senior scientist from CSIRO who attended Friday’s meeting said Marshall had confirmed 110 full-time equivalent staff would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere flagship, which has roughly 130 full time-equivalent staff. Another 120 staff would be cut from the land and water flagship, and a few more from other areas. 
In the email to staff on Thursday, Marshall said that since climate change was proven to be real, CSIRO could shift its focus.
“Everybody is laughing at Marshall’s statement,” the scientist told Guardian Australia. “Who is he to declare that climate change is answered? The IPCC says so many problems are not answered yet. And unless you know how the climate is changing, how do you adapt to it?”
Then, on the ABC’s program 7.30, Marshall further defended the shift saying universities were focused on the issue.
“The 7.30 response is a con,” the scientist said. “There are a lot of thing that universities cannot do.
“Because most university research is dependent on temporary research grants, many programs the CSIRO has built over decades would be impossible to reproduce.” 
One example he gave was Cape Grim, in north-west Tasmania, where the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology run an atmospheric monitoring station, one of only three in the world to get “baseline” data from the cleanest possible air. 
“We’ve been doing that for 40 years,” he said. “Universities are not doing the carbon budget or the carbon cycle. There are a lot of capabilities that are not in universities that are in CSIRO. Unless they have a new huge injection of funds this capability would be lost. This took us 40 years to build.”
Tony Haymet has previously been the Policy Director at CSIRO and the director of the SCRIPPS Institution of Oceanography in the US, where he is now a professor. He likened Larry Marshall’s management of the CSIRO to “schoolboys playing at being managers”.
“If you are a complete failure, what you do is take one of your best divisions, shut it down, and invest in your pet project,” Haymet said. 
“That’s the coward’s way out ... The job is to raise more resources. It’s like shutting down the Australian cricket team, saying we need a lacrosse team, and spending three decades investing in that.”
He said several key capabilities will be lost from the country and the world. 
“If this was a whole of government approach, and they said we want to take this capability from the CSIRO and park it at the Bureau of Meteorology or a university, that’s fine but I’ve been told they didn’t consult with stakeholders at all,” he said.
Haymet said the cuts are “a kick in the guts” to farmers, the fishing industry, the navy and people who live on the coast and is worried about sea level rise. 
“We’ve only seen the beginning of climate change. We don’t know what the heck is waiting for us,” he said.",563,0.054260089686098655,4.484304932735426e-4,0.027354260089686097,0.04977578475336323,0.36816143497757847,0.4443946188340807,4.484304932735426e-4,0.054260089686098655,4.484304932735426e-4,4.484304932735426e-4,2016-02-05

In an early morning radio interview on Wednesday, Shorten was asked four times about the cost to consumers of executing such a transition, but the Labor leader deflected, pointing to the costs of not acting.
With the Coalition intent on making energy policy a point of sharp partisan difference, Malcolm Turnbull pounced on the interview, telling reporters in Canberra the Labor leader had admitted “he had no idea what his reckless renewable energy target would cost, or what its consequences would be.”
“He confirmed precisely the criticism that we’ve made about Mr Shorten, that he is literally clueless on this subject, mindless, just like South Australia has been.”
Labor’s 50% by 2030 policy is not a RET, it is an “aspiration”. Labor’s election policy says the 50% national goal would work in concert with state-based RET schemes, which the prime minister has blasted consistently since a storm plunged South Australia into a statewide blackout last year.
During an interview with the ABC Shorten was pressed repeatedly about the practical consequences of the shift – the costs to consumers of executing such a significant transition in Australia’s energy mix.
Shorten attempted to explain the broad rationale for increasing renewables in Australia’s energy mix, and he said Labor believed there was “a range of levers which assist, from having an emissions intensive scheme and the energy intensity scheme in the energy industry, having a market trading scheme and an emissions trading scheme [and] looking at the rate of land clearing.”
Pressed again on the costs, Shorten declined any specifics, and said “there is a cost in not acting”.
“Our answer is very, very straightforward. We think the cost of not acting is far greater.”
“We don’t think we could sustain the cost as the Liberals are saying, of building new coal-fired power generation on the scale which Mr Turnbull is saying and we don’t think that, from insurance to drought to extreme weather events, that we can simply go business as usual.”
Australian National University research associate Hugh Saddler in July 2015 estimated Labor’s policy would increase wholesale market prices by four cents per kWh above present levels in every state market except South Australia.
By signing on to the Paris climate agreement, the Turnbull government has committed Australia to reducing emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030. Meeting those targets will impose costs on consumers.
The government has been advised by numerous experts that its Direct Action climate policy will not allow Australia to meet the Paris targets, and adopting an emissions intensity scheme, a form of carbon trading, would allow Australia to reduce emissions from energy at the least cost to households and businesses.
The government has thus far rejected that advice.",465,0.025523012552301255,0.2179916317991632,0.008786610878661089,4.184100418410042e-4,0.7451882845188285,4.184100418410042e-4,4.184100418410042e-4,4.184100418410042e-4,4.184100418410042e-4,4.184100418410042e-4,2017-02-15

But overtime is deadly. If we worked less we’d make fewer errors, address inequality and have a better life","Had you asked John Maynard Keynes what the biggest challenge of the 21st century would be, he wouldn’t have had to think twice.
Leisure. In fact, Keynes anticipated that, barring “disastrous mistakes” by policymakers (austerity during an economic crisis, for instance), the western standard of living would multiply to at least four times that of 1930 within a century. By his calculations, in 2030 we’d be working just 15 hours a week.
In 2000, countries such as the UK and the US were already five times as wealthy as in 1930. Yet as we hurtle through the first decades of the 21st century, our biggest challenges are not too much leisure and boredom, but stress and uncertainty.
What does working less actually solve, I was asked recently. I’d rather turn the question around: is there anything that working less does not solve?
Take climate change. A worldwide shift to a shorter working week could cut the CO2 emitted this century by half. Countries with a shorter working week have a smaller ecological footprint. Consuming less starts with working less – or, better yet – with consuming our prosperity in the form of leisure.
Overtime is deadly. Long working days lead to more errors: tired surgeons are more prone to slip-ups and soldiers who get too little shut-eye are more prone to miss targets. From Chernobyl to the space shuttle Challenger, overworked managers often prove to have played a role in disasters. It is no coincidence that the financial sector, which triggered the biggest disaster of the past decade, is absolutely groaning with people doing overtime.
Countless studies have shown that people who work less are more satisfied with their lives. In a recent poll conducted among working women, German researchers quantified the “perfect day”. The largest share of minutes (106) would go toward “intimate relationships”. Down at the bottom of the list were work (36) and commuting (33). The researchers noted that “in order to maximise wellbeing it is likely that working and consuming (which increases GDP) might play a smaller role in people’s daily activities compared with now”.
Obviously, you can’t simply chop a job up into smaller pieces. Nevertheless, researchers at the International Labour Organization have concluded that job sharing – in which two part-time employees split a workload traditionally assigned to one full-time worker – went a long way towards resolving the last economic crisis. Particularly in times of recession with spiking unemployment and production exceeding demand, sharing jobs can help to soften the blow.
Furthermore, countries with shorter working weeks consistently top gender-equality rankings. The central issue is achieving a more equitable distribution of work. Not until men do their fair share of cooking, cleaning and other domestic labour will women be free to fully participate in the broader economy. Take Sweden, a country with a truly decent system for childcare and paternity leave – and the world’s smallest work-time disparity between men and women.
Besides distributing jobs more equally between the sexes, we also have to share them across the generations. Older people increasingly want to continue working even after hitting pensionable age. But while thirtysomethings are drowning in work, family responsibilities and mortgages, seniors struggle to get hired, even though (some) working has proven health benefits. Young workers who are just entering the labour market may well continue working into their 80s. In return, they could put in not 40 hours a week for all those years, but perhaps just 20-30. “In the 20th century we had a redistribution of wealth,” one leading demographer has observed. “In this century, the great redistribution will be in terms of working hours.”.
And then there is the issue of economic inequality. The countries with the biggest disparities in wealth are precisely those with the longest working weeks. While the poor are working longer hours just to get by, the rich are finding it ever more “expensive” to take time off as their hourly rates rise. Nowadays excessive work and pressure are status symbols. Time to oneself is sooner equated with unemployment and laziness, certainly in countries where the wealth gap has widened.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We have the ability to cut a big chunk off our working week. Not only would it make all of society a whole lot healthier, it would also put an end to untold piles of pointless and even downright harmful tasks (a recent poll found that as many as 37% of British workers think they have a “bullshit job”). A universal basic income would be the best way to give everyone the opportunity to do more unpaid but incredibly important work, such as caring for children and the elderly.
“But wouldn’t everybody just be glued to the TV all the time?”, you may wonder. Actually, it is precisely in overworked countries like Japan, England and the US that people watch an absurd amount of television. Up to four hours a day in England, which adds up to nine years over an average lifetime. Sure, swimming in a sea of spare time won’t be easy. But that’s why a 21st century education should prepare people not only for joining the workforce, but also (and more importantly) for life. “Since men will not be tired in their spare time,” the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote in 1932, “they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid.”

Shortly after Trump’s announcement, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy released a joint statement rejecting Trump’s assertion that the climate deal can be redrafted.
“We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible, and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,” said German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni. 
The three leaders called on their allies to speed up efforts to combat climate change and promise to do more to help developing countries adapt.
Merkel called Trump immediately after he delivered his announcement to personally express her regret at his decision, her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Twitter.
During the conversation she stressed that Germany would stick to the agreement.
He added in another tweet in English: “Chancellor Merkel disappointed w/Pres. Trump’s decision. Now more than ever we will work for global policies that save our planet,” he wrote.
Chancellor Merkel disappointed w/ Pres. Trump's decision. Now more than ever we will work for global climate policies that save our planet.
Immediately after her call to Trump, Merkel telephoned Macron, he said, and they agreed that “Germany and France will grasp at new initiatives in order to ensure the climate agreement is a success”.
In a televised address in French and English, Macron said that Trump had “committed an error for the interests of his country, his people and a mistake for the future of our planet”.
 “I tell you firmly tonight: we will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way,” said Macron. “Don’t be mistaken on climate: there is no plan B because there is no planet B.” 
In contrast, the British government was slow to respond to the announcement. Downing Street issued a statement saying that Theresa May had told Trump of her “disappointment” at his decision and stressed that Britain remained committed to the agreement. 
Downing Street sources would not say whether the prime minister had been asked to sign the letter of condemnation sent by Germany, France and Italy, but said that she had made her point directly to Trump.
The unyielding response of Italy, France and Germany came amidst a tsunami of global condemnation for Trump’s decision to renege on an agreement made by 195 countries after decades of negotiation. The US will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only governments to be outside the agreement.
The most furious reaction was in Germany, where tomorrow’s front page of German tabloid Berliner Kurier carries the blunt headline: “Earth to Trump: Fuck You”.
Prime ministers of America’s neighbours condemned the decision and reaffirmed their support for the Paris agreement. In Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto said: “Mexico maintains its support and commitment to the Paris agreement to stop the effects of global climate change.”
The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, called Trump to express his disappointment at the decision, but said he was inspired by “the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies”.
The Vatican said a US pullout represented a “huge slap in the face” for the pope and a “disaster for everyone”. Pope Francis only days ago met Trump and impressed on him the importance of protecting the environment from climate change.
Japan’s foreign ministry said: “Climate change requires a concerted effort by the whole of the international community. Japan believes the leadership of the developed countries to be of great importance, and the steady implementation of the Paris agreement is critical in this regard. The recent announcement by the US administration on its withdrawal … is regrettable.”
In stronger comments, Japan’s environment minister, Koichi Yamamoto, said: “It’s as if they’ve turned their back on the wisdom of humanity.
“In addition to being disappointed, I’m also angry.”
In Australia, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was disappointed with Trump’s decision but reiterated the government’s full commitment to meeting its Paris targets. “We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable.”
New Zealand’s climate change minister, Paula Bennett, said that “so much of what [Trump] said is wrong”, arguing that America was not paying a disproportionate cost to be part of the deal.
Trump said he was taking his decision to protect US jobs. “We’re getting out,” the US president had said, in attacking the Paris accord’s financial burdens as “draconian”.
However, many business leaders say he has handed the advantage in the key field of renewable energy to rivals in China and the Europe. Scientists said they feared for their children. 
Environmentalists described the decision as a “hugely disappointing” mistake. Youth groups accused Trump of jeopardizing their future.
World leaders had already begun preparing for a US exit. China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said on Thursday that fighting climate change was a “global consensus” and an “international responsibility”. The EU and China have forged a new alliance on climate change and are currently midway through a summit in Brussels at the end of which they will announce plans to step up efforts.
The EU’s commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Cañete, said Trump’s unilateral decision marked a sad day for the global community, but he vowed the accord would endure.
 “Today’s announcement has galvanised us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership. Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way,” he said.
The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said: “It is a matter of trust and leadership. This decision will hurt the US and the planet.”
Izabella Teixeira, who lead the Brazilian negotiating team in 2015, described Trump’s announcement as a “heart attack” but said the world would survive. She dismissed suggestions that any new deal would have to ignore US historical emissions. “These are old ideas, old politics,” she told the Guardian.
United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the decision was a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security”. 
The Indian government did not immediately react to Trump’s announcement, which came shortly after 1am local time, but India’s energy minister recently reaffirmed the south Asian giant’s commitment to the global climate agreement. The world’s third-largest carbon pollution emitter is on course to exceed the renewable energy targets it set in Paris in 2015 by nearly 50%, and three years ahead of schedule.
Trump’s withdrawal announcement came in the late evening in Russia, and official commentary was not immediately available. But Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said earlier on Thursday that Russia “attaches great importance” to the Paris climate accord, and a US withdrawal could complicate the agreement’s implementation.
“Of course, the effectiveness and realisation of this convention will be hampered without key participants,” Peskov told journalists. “There is no alternative (to the accord) at this time.”
The US has long been a key – though not always enthusiastic – player in international efforts to mitigate the already apparent trends of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and intense droughts, floods and storms.
Trump is accused of jettisoning this international role and putting the domestic fossil fuel industry first. Though his term may be too short to complete the job he has begun.
Lukas Hermwille, scientific researcher in the field of international climate policy at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, drew attention to the fact that the exit from the agreement would anyway only come into effect in around three years’ time “ironically”, he told Die Welt, “on the day after the next US presidential election”. But Trump could still spend the rest of his time in office torpedoing climate protection from the inside out, he added.
 Environmental groups were appalled. Tanya Steele, CEO of WWF said the decision makes it harder for the world to reach a safer and more prosperous future. “It is hugely disappointing that President Trump is making the mistake in rowing back on the Paris agreement,” she said, “Climate change is a very real global issue that affects the successful future of our planet.”
Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory said the decision “creates the risk of a domino effect” that could put the target of keeping temperature rises below 2C (3.6F) out of reach, though he held out hope that global talks can make greater progress in reducing fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy in the absence of a country that has flitted back and forth between leadership and obstruction.
Many US mayors have said they will abide by climate commitments regardless of the White House U-turn. This was echoed by municipal leaders overseas.
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who chairs a group of 40 major cities, said: “No matter what decision is made by the White House, cities are honouring their responsibilities to implement the Paris agreement. There is no alternative for the future of our planet.”

The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) has estimated that output will reach 259.5m hectolitres (mhl) this year, making 2016 one of the lowest production years in the past two decades.
While the amount of wine produced should meet consumer demand, the figures are a reminder of how global warming and natural climate variability are having a profound effect on wine, and perhaps where it will be grown in future.
Italy is expected to produce the most wine in 2016, followed by France, Spain, the US, Australia and China. France is likely to remain in the top three, despite a predicted 12% drop in production to 41.9mhl.
The most precipitous declines are set to be in South America, a potential source of concern for fans of the malbec and carménère varieties. Production is estimated to have plummeted by 35% in Argentina and 21% in Chile, the seventh-biggest producer.
South Africa is set to report a 19% fall, but the news is better for Australia and New Zealand, which are expected to increase production by 5% and 35% respectively. The New Zealand figures would put it near a record it set in 2014. 
The OIV said the predicted overall decline was strongly affected by climatic events. “The El Niño climate phenomenon seems to be back in Latin America, where production was affected by fairly exceptional weather, with lots of rain,” said OIV’s chief executive, Jean-Marie Aurand.
El Niño, which occurs every four to five years, affects rainfall patterns and causes both drought and flooding. 
A report released earlier this year by the Earth Institute at Columbia University said warming temperatures, the main driver of grape harvest timing, have significantly pushed these periods forward globally. 
“Across the world, scientists have found that each degree centigrade of warming pushes grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days,” the report said. This phenomenon could eventually make pinot noir grapes unsuitable for many parts of Burgundy, according to a 2011 study by the climate scientist Yves Tourre.
A 2014 paper in journal Wine Economics and Policy concluded that rising temperatures would have an “extraordinary effect” on agriculture and there were few crops more susceptible than grapes to minor changes in climate.
In Europe, the paper pointed to a potential chilling of the Bordeaux region and parts of Spain, due to the loss of the Gulf Stream, while other regions, including Alsace, are expected to get warmer and experience shorter growth seasons. In the Italian region of Chianti, grapes have begun ripening too early, leading to possible future changes in wine varieties.",449,0.5221739130434783,0.12217391304347827,4.347826086956522e-4,0.34826086956521735,4.347826086956522e-4,4.347826086956522e-4,4.347826086956522e-4,0.004782608695652175,4.347826086956522e-4,4.347826086956522e-4,2016-10-20

While Gichuhi suggested clearly last week that she had been bullied – a suggestion that was validated implicitly by the minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, who said government MPs had been intimidated – Morrison told the ABC on Tuesday night the South Australian senator “told me very plainly that she was not bullied by anybody here in Canberra” during the leadership contest.
The prime minister met Gichuhi privately after she signalled she was prepared to name names with the protection of parliamentary privilege. Gichuhi confirmed the conversation earlier on Tuesday, and said Morrison had “taken up the issue”.
Regarding bullying in my political career: Yesterday I had a discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister has taken up the issue. #auspol
We must live and work in a way that respects and enhances ALL freedoms of ALL Australians. Australia says NO to bullying and intimidation. #auspol
Morrison said politics was a very “torrid” business and his inquiries to date had not yielded evidence of “gender-specific actions” in relation to what some people would characterise as “very intense lobbying which is fairly normal in the political process, albeit not edifying”.
He acknowledged there were some issues relating “to the party divisions and how things are dealt with there” but gave no detail.
The prime minister also said he would not support quotas being adopted in the Liberal party to boost female representation in parliament – an idea that has been floated by the Liberals Sussan Ley and Craig Laundy.
He said that determination was “a matter for the organisational wing of the Liberal party but [quotas are] never something I have supported”.
Even though there is ample evidence that quotas boost the level of female representation both in public and corporate life, Morrison said: “I don’t believe quotas are the way you remove obstacles.”
He said he was focused on removing obstacles to women getting preselected.
“It’s a matter of supporting women throughout the preselection process, to identify, encourage, support and recruit and then to support them through that process, and then when they get into parliament ensure they’re getting the support they need to do the job,” he said.
Morrison was also pressed again to explain why Malcolm Turnbull was no longer the prime minister, given that he was a strong defender of the government’s record, and argued that he didn’t actively seek the top job.
The prime minister has tried to move the questioning on from the leadership implosion and on Tuesday night said the government was focused on the future. He said the government had been preoccupied with managing things but further explanation was now required. “What’s important in politics is that people also understand the why’s behind the what.”
Even though opinion polls suggest Australian voters are disconcerted by yet another leadership coup, and the Coalition would lose any election held today, the prime minister suggested voters were “disappointed” but used to the turbulence.
“I think, sadly, over the last 10 years there have been too many of these changes, on both sides of politics and, I don’t think Australians are as shocked by these things as they used to be,” Morrison said. “They are disappointed.”
He struggled to explain the government’s position on climate and energy policy. Asked what the government’s climate policy was, Morrison replied: “Reducing emissions by 26%.”
Asked to nominate a policy to drive the emissions reduction, Morrison identified the emissions reduction fund, which was not given any additional funding in the last budget. He suggested further measures would be forthcoming but gave no detail.
Morrison declared the government had not changed its emissions reduction policy but the government on Monday took a decision to dump the national energy guarantee, a policy that would have imposed an emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% by 2030.
The prime minister has said since taking the top job that Australia will not dump the Paris climate commitment to reduce emissions across the economy by 26%. But in ditching the Neg the government has removed a concrete policy roadmap to drive the emissions reduction.
The government does not have policies to drive emissions reduction in sectors of the economy where emissions are now rising.
The Energy Security Board has predicted that emissions in the electricity sector will be 24% lower by 2021 courtesy of a big build of renewable energy pulled through by the renewable energy target, which is also contributing to lower wholesale prices.
But the ESB has said electricity will not reach a 26% reduction in the absence of the Neg.
Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target Australia has signed up to applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising.",835,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.005511811023622047,2.6246719160104987e-4,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.8664041994750656,2.6246719160104987e-4,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.008136482939632546,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.1183727034120735,2018-09-11

But there are a few problems,"People who work for climate science denial thinktanks tend not to spend all that much time worrying about getting stuff into scientific journals.
Perhaps because it’s easier, people who are paid to tell the public and policy makers that human-caused climate change is overblown bunk would rather pump out newspaper columns, do softball interviews or push out their own self-published reports. There’s a lot less scrutiny in that kind of public relations.
So when two staffers at Australia’s Institute of Public Affairs managed to get some “science” into a journal earlier this month, there was much delight in conservative media outlets, together with a distinct lack of any genuine scepticism. 
“Global Warming Is Almost Entirely Natural, Study Confirms,” wrote Breitbart. “Advanced Computer Models Suggest Most Global Warming Is From Natural Forces,” said the Daily Caller. 
One of the authors, Jennifer Marohasy, took to the Spectator to claim her research had shown that recent global warming was almost entirely natural. The web traffic behemoth the Drudge Report also linked to Marohasy’s article. 
None of the writers bothered to ask a single other genuine climate scientist for their view on the paper. 
I asked five. They variously summarised the research as “junk science” and seriously flawed. Oh dear.
Scientists including Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies; Prof Steven Sherwood, deputy director at the University of New South Wales climate change research centre; and Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley international centre for climate at the University of Leeds, have pointed out to me serious flaws and errors in the paper’s methodology.
It also appears that the lead author, the IPA’s John Abbot, claimed an academic affiliation to James Cook University that, according to that university, had expired more than six months before the research was submitted to the journal.
I emailed Abbot and Marohasy to ask them to respond to the key points but didn’t hear back. 
So what did Abbot and Marohasy do? Here’s where we get into the gory detail. 
First, the pair used what’s known as proxy temperature records. These are estimates of past temperatures going back as far as 50AD that have been estimated from analysis of things such as tree rings and lake sediments.
There are hundreds of these temperature records but the authors chose only six, and they don’t say why they chose the ones they did. 
They then fed these temperature records into several pieces of software and finally into another piece of software that performs a “machine learning” process. Out the other end comes a series of temperature reconstructions, from which Abbot and Marohasy make two claims. 
First, they claim that their resulting data shows the world would have warmed by almost as much as it already has, even if the industrial revolution had not happened and we had not added any extra greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. 
Second, they claim that if you were to double the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere then you would eventually see planet-wide warming of just 0.6C. Their estimate of this “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS) is much lower than other studies (the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says, for example, that studies show the likely range will be between 1.5C and 4C).
So what did the scientists think? 
Schmidt told me by email the paper was worthless “on a number of measures” and in his opinion demonstrated “what happens when people have their conclusions fixed before they start the work”.
Schmidt wrote that “conceptually this methodology can’t possibly work” because the way the authors had calculated the climate’s sensitivity had assumed that all the natural variability was part of the planet’s internal systems, rather than being “forced” externally by volcanic eruptions or changes in the output of the sun.
This, Schmidt said, was “in contradiction to their claims elsewhere in the paper.”
The analysis by the authors seems to work like magic
Schmidt also says “something went wrong” when Abbot and Marohasy digitised their results, meaning that for the northern hemisphere the data had shifted by about 35 years “so what they think is 2000, is actually 1965”. This meant that a huge part of modern warming had been missed.
Dr Benjamin Henley, of the University of Melbourne, has published several studies using proxy data to understand ancient climates. He says the paper should never have been published and should be withdrawn.
“The paper is seriously flawed and should be retracted by the journal,” Henley told me by email, pointing out several serious issues with the way the data had been used.
Henley questioned why only six “paleoclimate” records had been used, when a recent paper identified some 692 proxy records that could be used to determine temperatures.
He said the authors had not tried to verify their approach by comparing their data to actual temperature measurements – an “extremely unscientific approach”.
“The results are incorrectly interpreted and are not verified or even compared to observed instrumental data. The conclusions are not supported by the results.”
Forster reviewed the paper and told me he thought “the methodology is unphysical” because it simply took data and then extrapolated it rather than accounting for what was actually known to be happening in the real world.
Forster said the paper contained “fundamental errors” and gave me a detailed rundown.
For example, Forster says Marohasy and Abbot’s methodology assumes that all previous natural swings, or oscillations, in temperature that happened before the industrial revolution would continue up to present day. 
In reality there a very few periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the Earth system. In reality most are random and not periodic. Volcanoes are the biggest issue. Their method assumes that any periodicity caused by volcanoes prior to 1880 has simply continued though to 2000. We know this is not the case and have a good handle on what volcanic activity has been – it was nothing like it was prior to 1880. Their approach is therefore completely unphysical. They also assume that oscillations seen at a given proxy location will also cause the same oscillation on global average or hemispheric average temperatures. We know this is not the case.
He said the authors had assumed most of the 1C warming that the planet had seen was caused by random variation, “but we know this is not the case.” He said the paper’s conclusion the ECS was only 0.6C could be ruled out entirely. 
He said: “Attribution studies with careful statistics put random variability (of the climate) as contributing a maximum of around 0.2C. With 1C of warming already, and only halfway to doubling CO2, we can rule out ECS below about 1.5 C already.” 
Sherwood wrote: “The analysis by the authors seems to work like magic. 
“What is interesting about this fancy curve-fitting exercise is that the authors are doing exactly what mainstream climate scientists have falsely been accused of doing: extrapolating into the future from short past records.
“There is much evidence that recent warming is unprecedented, for example ancient ice in various mountain regions such as Peru that is now melting for the first time in millennia. Thus the authors’ conclusion is contradicted by direct physical evidence. Also, the authors are alleging that the climate can exert large natural swings in temperature but is insensitive to heating. This is a contradiction.”
Prof David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, told me the study “appears to be junk science” and listed several major issues with the paper’s methodology.
He said the authors had not bothered to describe the detailed method they had used to calculate ECS, adding: “ECS is based on global mean temperature changes and cannot be estimated without the globally averaged temperature estimates first.”
“In my view the claimed conclusions are not supported by the methods used and the results are likely to be unreliable,” he said. 
So none of this is a surprise. 
The IPA, which does not have to reveal its funders, has long pushed climate science denial, while promoting fossil fuels and denigrating renewable energy. It’s what they do. 
According to the journal manuscript, Marohasy and Abbot list their affiliations as the IPA and the Climate Modelling Laboratory. 
The Climate Modelling Laboratory is a trading name linked to Marohasy’s personal business number. 
Abbot also adds James Cook University (JCU) to his list of affiliations. 
But a JCU spokesperson told me: “John Abbot is no longer affiliated with James Cook University. He was an adjunct senior research fellow between October 2015 and September 2016.”
According to the journal’s website, and confirmed by a journal editor, Abbot and Marohasy submitted their manuscript to the journal in 22 April 2017 – more than six months after Abbot’s affiliation with JCU had ended.
I also asked Abbot and Marohasy about the nature of the Climate Modelling Laboratory and the affiliation to JCU but have not had a response. 
The journal editor who handled the Abbot paper, Dr Vasile Ersek, of Northumbria University in the UK, said he was “sorry to see it involved in a controversy” but said the article “was reviewed by two independent referees and neither found major flaws with the manuscript”.
As I’ve written on Planet Oz before, Marohasy has repeatedly claimed that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is deliberately conspiring to tamper with its temperature records with the express intention to make global warming look worse than it is. 
Marohasy was also the editor of the IPA’s most recent climate book – a collection of essays from a line-up of climate science deniers and contrarians.
The IPA said the book had contributions from “some of the world’s leading experts”. Among these “leading experts” is a New Zealander who has written several New Age-style books on cats (including Pawmistry: How to Read Your Cats Paws) while being the “king of rubber-band magic”.",1609,0.035104895104895104,1.3986013986013986e-4,1.3986013986013986e-4,1.3986013986013986e-4,0.05608391608391609,0.8826573426573426,1.3986013986013986e-4,1.3986013986013986e-4,1.3986013986013986e-4,0.025314685314685316,2017-08-25

Climate change is the top issue in Coogee, currently held by the Liberals on a margin of 2.9%, and Balmain, which Labor hopes to reclaim from the Greens, which holds it by 4.7%.
Weatherill said the NSW Coalition had been a barrier to getting action on climate change when states tried to achieve an agreement on pricing carbon in the face of the federal Coalition’s inaction.
“I think the conservative forces have completely misapprehended the community’s demand to take action on climate change and I think there will be very substantial judgments made by the electorates,” he said.
“When the states were trying to search for a mechanism to put a price on carbon in the national electricity market – just about everyone in the universe thinks it’s a good idea – [the Berejiklian government] were backing the commonwealth’s compromise,” he said.
As Labor premier for six years until 2018, Weatherill put South Australia at the forefront of adopting renewable power, which now provides 50% of the state’s electricity.
However, a statewide blackout in 2017 during a ferocious storm, which caused windfarms to shut down and led to a chain of events that cut the interconnectors bringing electricity from interstate, prompted federal criticism of renewable energy and questions about whether intermittent power from renewables was viable.
Weatherill responded by announcing a tender for a giant battery to stabilise the system, which was won by Tesla and built in under six months.
He told the Guardian that the battery has almost paid for itself in a year. “It cost us $46m over 10 years; in its first year of operation it saved people in the SA region $45m. It’s largely paid for itself in 12 months, not to mention the stabilisation services its provided to the national electricity market,” Weatherill said.
Famously, the then federal minister for energy Josh Frydenberg and Weatherill locked horns at a joint press conference over SA’s energy strategy.
Frydenberg accused SA of trying to “go it alone” and Weatherill of “crash-tackling” his event.
Weatherill hit back, claiming the Coalition was the “most anti-South Australian commonwealth government in living history”.
Elly Howse, who is attempting to unseat the Greens’ Jamie Parker in Balmain, said the problem for minor parties was delivering on the promises they make.
“If we don’t win, we will have four more years of a void in this policy space, and it doesn’t matter how much your local Green might be saying about this issue,” she said.
Marjorie O’Neill, Labor’s candidate for Coogee, said climate change and the environment was the issue most raised with her, followed by overdevelopment and education.
She said single-use plastics was a major concern in the beachside electorate. “Every other state has banned them except NSW,” she said.",478,0.009502262443438915,0.1497737556561086,0.02760180995475113,0.02760180995475113,0.6972850678733031,4.5248868778280545e-4,4.5248868778280545e-4,0.009502262443438915,4.5248868778280545e-4,0.07737556561085973,2019-03-19

In a 58-page report that has been circulated before Friday’s Council of Australian Governments meeting between the prime minister and the premiers, Finkel has also given implicit endorsement to an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity industry to help manage the transition to lower-emissions energy sources.
While there is no concrete recommendation to that effect, the report, obtained by Guardian Australia, references the evidence from energy regulators that such a scheme would integrate best “with the electricity market’s pricing and risk management framework” and “had the lowest economic costs and the lowest impact on electricity prices”.
Finkel also notes advice from the Climate Change Authority which says market mechanisms have the lowest average cost of abatement, and of the options modelled, an emissions intensity scheme “had the lowest impact on average residential electricity prices”.
The positive commentary from the chief scientist cuts directly across political arguments the Turnbull government has made since dumping its nascent attempt to use the review of the Direct Action policy to explore an intensity trading scheme for electricity – equating carbon pricing with higher power prices for consumers.
The Finkel report was commissioned by the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the last meeting of state and federal energy ministers, which followed the political controversy that erupted after South Australia endured a statewide blackout in September.
The Turnbull government has wanted to use the much-anticipated report as a springboard to wind back state-based renewable energy targets, which it says are making the electricity market less secure.
But while noting renewables present ongoing challenges to network stability, challenges that have to be carefully managed, Finkel has pointedly warned the federal government its current climate policy is inadequate as it stands.
He also makes the point that a lack of clarity at a federal level about policy and regulatory settings can also affect network security and prices for consumers.
Finkel’s report says the relatively short horizon of federal climate policy, coupled with the Abbott government’s attack on the federal renewable energy target, has put investment in abeyance.
“There is evidence that investment in the electricity sector has stalled and investors have become less responsive to investment signals,” the report says. “This is due to policy instability and uncertainty driven by numerous reviews into the renewable energy target and a lack of clarity about the policies to reduce emissions after 2020.”
“Investment in renewable energy dropped by 52% between 2013 and 2014 and has not yet recovered to the level required to satisfy the RET [renewable energy target].”
Finkel says there is a pressing need for clarity in policy to unlock much-needed investment in the national electricity market, and he says if the clarity fails to materialise, electricity prices will rise for consumers, and energy security will become more of an issue. 
“For businesses to take risks on the future and invest, they need to be confident that emissions reduction policies and the mechanisms to achieve them are consistent with Australia’s international commitments and will not change drastically in the future.”
“Because of the long-term nature of electricity sector investments, investment confidence depends strongly on long-term policy signals.”
“The lack of predictability in the electricity sector creates uncertainty around which generation and network assets investors should either invest in or divest from.”
“If businesses do not invest when needed, this will impact on the security and reliability of electricity supply.”
He also says explicitly the current climate policy, which includes Direct Action, the RET, and the national energy productivity plan, will not guarantee Australia meets its Paris commitments. “While the electricity sector must play an important role in reducing emissions, current policy settings do not provide a clear pathway to the level of reduction required to meet Australia’s Paris commitments,” the report says.
Finkel says the RET is designed to achieve an increase in large-scale renewable energy generation to 2020 “but not beyond”. “The policy also ends in 2030, meaning that projects commencing in 2020 will need to recover their capital costs over only a 10-year period.”
He says the Direct Action policy has focused predominantly on land-sector abatement, with very few projects seeking to improve the efficiency of electricity consumption.
Finkel says the safeguard mechanism “is not calibrated to drive emissions reduction”.
The Turnbull government on Monday flagged an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy.
But the overture was dumped when Frydenberg folded in the face of internal pressure – a decision which has been widely criticised as short sighted and counterproductive by business, the energy industry and climate groups.
Friday’s Coag meeting will also hear a push from the South Australian government to revive emissions trading in the wake of the Turnbull government’s decision to preemptively rule it out.
But the push from the premier, Jay Weatherill, appears unlikely to secure unanimous support from other state governments.
South Australia has been leading the charge on an emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector for some months, but New South Wales rebuffed the push on Thursday. The Labor governments in Victoria and Queensland have also backed away from carbon pricing in favour of beefing up their state renewables policies.
Before Friday’s talks, Malcolm Turnbull continued efforts to equate carbon pricing with higher electricity prices, and he revived previous criticism of the South Australian government’s positive disposition to renewable energy.
“What South Australia is doing is putting at risk the jobs of South Australians, the prospects of South Australian business. Jay Weatherill’s approach to energy has been condemned by the business community in South Australia, they’re appalled,” Turnbull told 3AW on Thursday.
“Major industrial centres – Whyalla, mines, Nyrstar mine and so forth – have had to close down because they don’t get reliable power,” he said. “The South Australian Labor government has delivered an absolute double whammy of not being able to keep the lights on and having the most expensive electricity in Australia.”
But the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, blasted Turnbull for his conduct over the course of the week. “Malcolm Turnbull is demonstrating that he is under pressure, that he is lashing out, and that now he is making terrible decisions about the future of climate change and what governments can do about it,” Shorten said.
“Malcolm Turnbull has been muted on taking proper action on climate change. He has been gagged from talking about the solutions we need to tackle harmful carbon pollution.”
“This week has become the sickest joke of climate change policy since Malcolm Turnbull got elected.”",1105,1.6750418760469013e-4,0.1576214405360134,0.011892797319932999,0.0035175879396984926,0.825963149078727,1.6750418760469013e-4,1.6750418760469013e-4,1.6750418760469013e-4,1.6750418760469013e-4,1.6750418760469013e-4,2016-12-08

The prime minister also denied accusations that his decision to sign a contract guaranteeing that 12 submarines would be built in South Australia was a consequence of an agreement he made with federal MP for SA Christopher Pyne and senator Simon Birmingham in exchange for their support when he challenged Tony Abbott for the leadership.
“I’m not going to go into the ins and outs of the change of leadership,” he said.
Speaking on ABC radio in Adelaide on Wednesday, Turnbull said the $50bn submarines deal his government has struck with French company DCNS  would be signed by the end of the year.
The deal would allow for all the submarines to be built in Australia, rather than overseas. While it was a more expensive option, it was important for local jobs, he said.
“The difference between the cost of building all the submarines in France and all the submarines in Australia ... is a very manageable one,” he said. “It’s not the huge figure that people have speculated about.
“It is [also] critically important that with a sovereign defence capability we have the skills in Australia to build it, to maintain it, to sustain it. It is important that it is built in Australia ... as a matter of national security.”
He denied speculation he was keen to sign such a contract to hold up his end of a deal with his South Australian colleagues.
“I honestly think you’re trying to turn a great opportunity ... for Adelaide and South Australia into a debate about politics,” he said.
Abbott had pushed strongly for the submarines contract to be awarded to Japan ahead of France when he was in office.
After the French-won submarines contract was announced on Tuesday, Abbott sent a letter to Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, thanking him for trying to win the contract, according to reports.
On climate change policy, Turnbull said Labor’s new proposal to introduce two emissions trading schemes if it wins the election would “double the burden” on Australia relative to other countries.
The first scheme, for big industrial polluters, would force power generators to pay for the closure of a competitor’s dirty brown-coal-fired plant, while the second scheme, an electricity industry-specific “intensity based” trading scheme, is similar to one once backed by Turnbull himself.
Labor says the policy would minimise the hit on household power bills but it has left important details to be determined after the election.
Turnbull said the Coalition already had a strong climate change policy and he criticised Labor for wanting to run too far ahead of the rest of the world.
“We agreed with the rest of the global community on emissions reduction targets by 2030 ... our commitment is very substantial – it’s to reduce our emissions by 26-28% on a per-capita basis,” he said.
“Labor is proposing nearly twice as much: 45%. That is well above what we committed to at Paris and will put a very big burden on Australians.
“What they’re proposing is to double the burden on Australia, relative to other countries ... When a similar target was modelled on the basis of Labor’s previous scheme, it would have required a very substantial increase in electricity prices.”
Turnbull then warned the rest of the world would not be inspired to follow Labor’s lead.
“The key thing with climate change is to ensure that you get global action and so if one country decides to – just say there’s a change of government and they double their particular cut in emissions – that’s not going to motivate others to do any more,” he said. “Others will just say thanks very much.”
At a later press conference, Turnbull again attacked Labor’s plan for its likely economic consequences. “This is yet another economic handbrake that Labor is putting on our economy, another restraint on jobs to add to all the other job-destroying measures they’re proposing,” he said.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said unlike the Coalition, Labor accepts climate science and is prepared to avoid the high costs of inaction.
“We do not consider climate change a question of ‘belief’, we know it is an economic and environmental reality ... The cost of inaction, to our economy and the environment, will be profound. This is not a price Labor is prepared to make the next generation of Australians pay,” Shorten said.",742,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.05805471124620061,3.0395136778115504e-4,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.7328267477203647,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.203951367781155,0.0033434650455927053,3.0395136778115504e-4,3.0395136778115504e-4,2016-04-27

The situation is less paradoxical than it sounds, because Brexit is a project based on an assertion of what the country does not want to be – a member of the EU – without a clear articulation of what it should be instead. That omission will be felt keenly, but not discussed, at Sunday’s extraordinary summit, where Theresa May and the 27 other European heads of government are expected to agree the broad outlines of a future partnership. But this “deal” will not answer the existential question that Brexit raises: if Britain’s influence in the world is no longer to be deployed as part of a European project, how will it be felt?
The leave campaign did not recognise that as a legitimate question because Eurosceptics always saw “Brussels” as a hostile force and a drain on the sovereign power of a nation state. Brexit, in that view, offered enhanced status as “Global Britain”. That fantasy, like so many of the leaver pledges, has been dismantled by events. The dynamics of a 27-to-one negotiation have demonstrated how a continental bloc asserts power greater than the sum of its parts and greater than any one European country can wield alone. Power in the world is not simply a matter of autonomy to sign trade deals. EU membership has been an axiom of British foreign and security policy well beyond the arena of economic cooperation. To jettison that arrangement would have been risky at any point in recent decades. With Donald Trump in the White House, the timing is exquisitely poor. Mr Trump has started a trade war with China that looks like the prologue to a long confrontation between superpowers. Traditionally, a US president would look to Europe for strategic alliance under such circumstances, but Mr Trump has also picked trade fights with Brussels and heaped scorn on the EU.
Britain does not have to pick a side in this volatile environment but it will have to express priorities. The national interest will often demand alignment with our continental neighbours. That is a fact of culture, history, geography and realpolitik. Historians will look back and wonder how it was that Britain could make such consequential decisions about its role in the world without them featuring in domestic debate. The parochialism of cabinet rows has crowded out strategic challenges. Urgent, global issues are scarcely discussed: climate change; the potential uses and abuses of artificial intelligence and genomics; large-scale population migrations. These are forces that will reshape human society, and it is hard to see how a medium-sized, albeit rich, nation can grapple with them alone.
The most influential actors will be those that can operate on continental scale – China, the US, India, the EU. Such gigantism requires political deftness and skill to navigate. There will be questions about how much freedom ought to be devolved within such superpowers. Once a key player in such debates, we will be a bystander. Britain is recusing itself from that level of influence, downgrading its clout in the world. That might be what many voters want, or at least a price they are willing to pay for Brexit. It is difficult to know, when the question has never been put in those terms. This weekend’s meeting in Brussels is all about Britain and what Mrs May has negotiated. There needs to be more focus on the question of what future British prime ministers will be able to achieve after Mrs May has surrendered the UK’s seat at the summit table.",611,3.703703703703704e-4,3.703703703703704e-4,3.703703703703704e-4,3.703703703703704e-4,0.07814814814814815,3.703703703703704e-4,0.5151851851851852,0.07814814814814815,0.09296296296296297,0.23370370370370372,2018-11-23

Don’t debate with them | Molly Scott Cato,"A Ukip MEP has written a shamefully ignorant climate change report for the EU – it should never have happened, says the Green MEP Molly Scott Cato","After a long, hot summer beset by record temperatures, drought and deadly fires, imagine my shock, on returning to the European parliament, to be confronted with a report that denies the reality of climate change. Given it could influence the allocation of the next round of environment funding under the EU’s Life programme, it is deeply disturbing to see such a report, based on wholly discredited science, wending its way down the corridors of Brussels.
Some of the claims made by the report’s author, the Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew, are, frankly, pretty hair-raising. For instance, he claims that the effect of CO2 levels on our climate is “negligible”, and that it is “one of agriculture’s greatest friends”. Agnew claims there is a lack of concentration of CO2 and as a result there is no problem for the EU to solve.
So how could it be that someone with a track record of shameful ignorance of the science of climate change ends up being assigned the task of compiling this report?
Unbelievably, the decision to appoint Agnew was met with support from Christian Democrat, Conservative and Liberal members of the European parliament’s agriculture committee, while the Socialists and Democrats, supported by the Greens, attempted to challenge the decision to give Agnew the leading role.
Quite rightly, in response to this news, climate experts have reacted with disbelief and anger. Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and environment at the London School of Economics, said: “There is not a single scientific institution in the world that would agree with this daft assessment. This document demonstrates how Ukip’s climate change denial is putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of people in the UK and across the European Union.” Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, also ridiculed the report: “The hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush. This will be a wonderful resource when [my students] discuss the ill-informed ideas that bounce around the echo chamber of climate change denial.”
What this fiasco reveals is the huge threat to rational climate action posed by the rise of the far right. It also shows the risks from Brexit, as the links between climate denial and Brexit are well documented. For example,the long-standing supporter of Brexit and arch-neoliberal Nigel Lawson founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation to oppose climate change mitigation policies. He labelled the Kyoto protocol “wrongheaded”, and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be shut down.
Lawson may be considered an irrelevant dinosaur, though he still manages to platform his nonsense at regular intervals on the BBC. But the man who Conservative MP Anna Soubry declared was now running the country, the hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has blamed high energy prices on “climate alarmism” and has said it was unrealistic for scientists to project future climate changes, just as it was difficult for meteorologists to correctly predict the weather. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, adding to a litany of ill-informed comments on climate change, earlier this year declared that the “beast from the east” was proof that global warming wasn’t real. And of course, favouring supposed “alternative facts” on climate change is a prejudice shared by other far-right groups, most notably Donald Trump’s circle.
Given the dangers posed by the far right and the very real threat of a significant bloc of populist, climate change-denying MEPs after next year’s European elections, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to take back control. That is why I joined other politicians, scientists, academics and campaigners in signing a letter pledging we would refuse to debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. We can no longer give voice to the pseudo-science of climate change deniers; we must urgently move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate breakdown.
The large right and centre-right groups in the European parliament could and should have blocked Ukip from taking charge of a report on climate change. We can only hope that the mainstream groups in parliament – right, left and centre – that are likely to continue to control the majorities will show a greater degree of responsibility in future.

Its propellers rusty and brown, its wings cracked and bent.
“Why did I bring you into this world?” I thought. “How could I possibly have thought that was a good idea?” A surge of tears pushed against my throat. I swallowed and turned away. 
In my hand was my iPad, the device I read all my books on. My husband insists he can’t sleep with any lights on so I’ve reverted to reading in the dark on night vision. My obsession with post-apocalyptic literature, however, seems fitting for the dark. 
The obsession began with a friend’s recommendation for Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven, a book about a travelling theatre group who journey from scattered camp to camp, performing Shakespeare to anyone who survived the flu pandemic. I fell in love with this disease-ravaged, post-electricity world where artists were the saviours, the rememberers of culture and romance and imagination. I was hooked.
The next book recommendation I received was Clade by Australian author James Bradley. Clade begins with a scientist working in Antarctica while his wife is trying to conceive via IVF in Sydney. He becomes increasing frustrated with society’s refusal to heed the warnings of climate change, which leads him to feeling more and more anxious about the idea of bringing a child into this world. The book goes on to span multiple generations, showing the slow but devastating results of climate change on future generations. It is epic.
Right there is where the seed was planted for me. Something to do with the adventure-fantasy of a new world where none of the rules apply anymore, combined with the very real possibility of environmental collapse, made the stakes so much higher and the book all the more riveting. As I continued on this cli-fi (climate fiction) bender, a creature grew inside of me. It started off small and restless in my belly, and over the months it grew teeth and claws.
One day, Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything entered my periphery and something twigged. I realised all the post-apocalyptic cli-fi books had led me to this moment. Enough of the fiction. Enough of the hinting. If the world was going to end, I wanted to read the facts. Hit me in the face with them, fuck it, let’s do this.
Well, This Changes Everything did just that. If you do nothing else, just read the introduction to this most terrifying of apocalyptic non-fiction books. To learn that the very thing that drives our culture – profit and growth – is the very thing that is going to kill us was more terrifying than any flu pandemic story I’d read thus far.
That at the root of our problem is possibly who we are as a species seemed more hopeless and paralysing than any zombie apocalypse. Then, when Klein spoke about the very real prospect of our children having to battle serious environmental collapse in their lifetime, I just fell apart.
The creature inside me was thrashing about. “What have I done?” There my son was, glowing in all his angelic innocence, playing with the product of this sick, disposable dream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to collapse down to my knees, hold him and tell him I was sorry. That I didn’t know what the future held and I was scared. So scared. But instead, I watched him in all his wonder, in his blissful little bubble and I stayed there. If only for a sweet, sweet moment, I stayed there and I forgot.

To have no mention anywhere of the 12 years we (at best) have to make any difference is a shocking omission. Climate change is the greatest issue the world is facing and readers can’t have the message highlighted enough.
Can I also ask that you don’t print any letters suggesting that all we need to do is turn our thermostat down and consume more responsibly? As Naomi Klein illustrates in This Changes Everything, the idea that climate change can be solved by personal responsibility alone is a fallacy (and one of the reasons why we are in this mess).
This issue requires policymakers everywhere to act now but they won’t do it if they don’t think people care, which is why it is the responsibility of the press to report the danger we are in.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex
• The collapse of civilisation is on the horizon, David Attenborough told the UN’s annual climate conference in Poland. We are privileged that the first people’s seat at the conference was filled by one of our greatest national treasures. A few words from him in Blue Planet 2 led to the start of a transformation of our relationship with plastic.
But, this is the thin end of the wedge compared with the changes required to enable our children to live out their lives peacefully. We need to radically change our relationship with what we eat, how we heat our houses, where our power comes from and how we transport ourselves. Four years ago the economist Lord Stern said we need an effort that surpasses the combined efforts of the first and second world wars to tackle the approaching existential threat.
To meet the changes we need strong political leadership, nationally and locally to steer through this unprecedented time. I look around the local political landscape and see very few people from any party willing to meet the challenge.
Since this year’s IPCC report, both Bristol and Manchester have voted unanimously to declare a climate emergency. Our national government is focusing on Brexit, which is merely a distraction in the face of what is the greatest threat our species has ever faced.
We need a new generation of political leaders to emerge and put our collapsing climate at the heart of all their policies.Caspar HughesExeter, Devon
• Your editorial’s revelation (6 December) that the 2014-16 carbon reductions were the result of an economic slowdown that helped fuel the rise of populism appears daunting for future climate-change initiatives. However, rising carbon emissions and extreme rightwing electoral advances can be reversed. This will require a massive increase in economic activity arising from environmental policies that are clearly seen to improve prospects for the majority through an emphasis on green jobs in every community.
The obvious starting point is to make every home, commercial and industrial building energy efficient worldwide. In the US this is one of the central demands of the youngest of the new members of Congress, Alexandria Ocasio–Cortez, with her call for a select committee for a green new deal, an initiative supported by Bernie Sanders and other elected progressives. Also key will be the rapid transition to renewables and low-carbon local transport systems.
To reduce political opposition to such a shift will require cash to help communities initially threatened by such measures, from scrappage schemes for polluting cars, subsidies for a rapid growth in electric public and private transport, through to job conversion schemes for Polish coal miners threatened by the latest climate talks.
The massive amount of money required should come from higher but fairer taxes, while hammering tax dodgers, with increased public expenditure and incentives for affluent savers to invest in such schemes. If this proves inadequate then green quantitative easing should also be introduced. The world really has no other choice.Colin HinesEast Twickenham, Middlesex
• We are hurtling towards a climate apocalypse (no hyperbole), and yet the one thing everyone can do is given surprisingly little publicity: change your energy supplier to one which only uses renewable energy.
We recently changed our supplier to one of several companies offering 100% renewable energy. The change-over was easy, and we now keep our house snuggly warm, comfortable in the knowledge that we are helping to save the planet. Please, everyone, change to a green supplier. Together we can save the world.Daniel Emlyn-JonesOxford
• Before claiming that the wheel, agriculture and gene-edited girls are “Monolith moments” (Letters, 5 December), remember that the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey were of alien origin. While the monolith in the Dawn of Man sequence may or may not have triggered the use of weapons, the discovery of the second monolith, buried on the moon, served only to send a signal, possibly a warning, to the alien intelligence of mankind’s first steps into space. This led to the encounter with a monolith in Jupiter space, the star gate and astronaut Bowman’s journey “beyond the infinite” and his return to Earth as the star child. Alas, there is no sign today of any alien coming to help us avoid the collapse of civilisation predicted by David Attenborough at the UN climate change summit. We have to do that by ourselves.Graeme CottamPetersfield, Hampshire
• Rather than being “most worrying”, the UN report suggesting “that the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of the economic slowdown” (Editorial, 6 December) indicates that we urgently need more economic slowdowns.David MurrayWallington, Surrey

The base was built on an island surrounded by a thick shelf of ice called Larsen A. Ten soldiers manning the base noticed strange pools of melted water appearing on the ice surface, followed by gurgling noises as water drained through cracks in the ice, whilst far below came deep rumbling sounds. Shortly after, a monstrous collapse shook the base as the whole of Larsen A suffered a colossal implosion and shattered into a melange of icebergs. That was followed by the collapse of more ice shelves along the Peninsula.
Because ice shelves float on the sea their melting didn’t add to rising sea levels. The ice shelves did, however, act as a brake on glaciers, and when they vanished the glaciers were free to slide into the sea and melt, incrementally adding to the threat of rising sea levels. 
Rising global temperatures remain a concern – just last year, the Antarctic Peninsula set a new record temperature of 17C for Antarctica and prolonged warming and subsequent ice shelf collapses have wide ranging global implications.
A far greater worry is the giant West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet is buttressed by fringes of floating sea ice, which, if a similar collapse were to take place, could be enough to set off a chain reaction leading to a vast ice-sheet recession over just a few decades. If it melted completely scientists think that it could add as much as three metres to global sea levels, and that would spell catastrophe for low lying coasts around the world.

The hunt is on for her replacement, the UN job portal is open, the salary in the region of $200,000 (£143,000).
Applicants need to demonstrate vision, communication skills, experience of working with senior leaders and be a patient sort.
With less than five years until a new global pact comes into force, it’s a critical time for whoever takes over, with the prospect of little glory but plenty of graft.
On the downside you have to live in Bonn. On the upside it requires a lot of travel so you won’t be there much.
The UN climate body has only had four heads: one from Malta, two from the Netherlands and the incumbent from Costa Rica. History favours candidates from small countries, not permanent members of the UN security council.
Climate Home has canvassed opinion from the international climate change community – here’s a rundown of the top 10 names being discussed (in no particular order).
Mexico’s ambassador to Germany is highly regarded in climate circles, having taken over the presidency of the UN talks in 2010 with the Copenhagen hangover still raging. Careful diplomacy and a tight alliance with Figueres saw the Cancun talks get back on track after the Danish disaster.
If the UN wants to emphasise its commitment to implementation between now and 2020, the executive director of the International Energy Agency could be a decent bet. The Turkish economist is on the UN’s Sustainable Energy 4 All panel and is a respected media performer.
Lima’s environment chief has an election coming up, potentially freeing him up for other pursuits. Credited with ensuring UN talks were more open and transparent in 2014, MPV was asked to assist COP21 president Laurent Fabius in Paris as a bridge with civil society groups.
The lean and quiet environment minister of the Gambia lives on the frontline of climate change, a powerful advocate for investment in adaptation and loss and damage. One-time head of the Least Developed Countries group was chosen to be one of Fabius’ advisors in the closing stages of Paris.
Diseko brought a touch of drama and glamour to UN talks through 2015, fiercely defending the 134-strong Group of 77 she was charged with leading. She’s an old hand at the UN and one of the key advisors to the South African government during the 2011 COP17 summit in Durban.
Former chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Grenada ambassador to the UN and Oxfam climate advisor, Williams is a UN talks veteran. She’s another potential candidate who lives on the climate frontline, often writing about the impact of rising sea levels on her home.
An architecture critic, author, economist and diplomat, there are apparently few subjects Corrêa do Lago cannot discuss with authority. Brazil’s smooth and media-friendly ambassador to Japan was – until 2012 – its head of climate negotiations, and chief negotiator at the Rio+20 talks.
Secretary of state for climate change between 2008-2011, Ribera now runs the Paris-based IDDRI thinktank, which played a key behind-the-scenes role helping the French government at COP21. An established name on the circuit, Ribera has also led IDDRI’s Latin American outreach.
If Laurent Fabius was the face of the UN climate talks, Tubiana was the brains trust behind the project, advising the COP president on the technical aspects of a climate deal. A warm personality who made many new friends in the past year, it’s doubtful she’d want to swap Paris for Bonn.
When Paris looked in trouble, France turned to Teixeira to resolve the developed v developing divide at UN talks.

5cc081dda2c3613145ed8f8f,article,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/27/coral-bleaching-is-getting-worse-but-the-biggest-problem-is-pollution,Oscar Lopez,1,Environment,"Coral, Oceans, Climate change, Environment, Marine life, Wildlife, Mexico, Americas, World news, Pollution, Belize, UK news",12,1514370615000,0,0,'Coral bleaching is getting worse ... but the biggest problem is pollution',Conservationists are battling to save the 700-mile Mesoamerican Barrier Reef in the Caribbean suffering the effects of mass tourism and global warming,"The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef is the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere – an underwater wilderness stretching over 700 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.
One of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the Americas, the reef is home to a dazzling variety of coral and more than 500 species of fish, and provides a livelihood for more than a million people. But now, a combination of mass tourism and poor waste management has left the reef increasingly vulnerable to climate change, placing this natural wonder in serious trouble.
“Throughout the Caribbean, we have seen a massive decrease in coral coverage,” says Michael Webster, executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance, a nonprofit organisation that works on reef conservation in Honduras. “Whereas we might have had 60-70% coral coverage in the past, now it’s down to 5-10% in places.”
Now, the rapidly changing climate could make the damage even worse. “We’re seeing these huge variations in rainfall, temperature, weather,” says Amanda Acosta, executive director of the Belize Audubon Society, a nonprofit responsible for managing reefs off the coast of Belize. “In 2012, we had massive rainfall,” she says. “Last year, we had no rain at all. And in the summer, the sea was as warm as a bath pan.”
The impacts of these rapid weather changes are already being witnessed across the reef system. Jesús Arias-González, a researcher at the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico, conducted a study of the entire region last year and found 22% of the coral colonies presented signs of bleaching from elevated sea temperatures. The bleaching could soon get worse: in September the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began issuing coral bleaching alerts all along the Mesoamerican Reef. While cooler winter waters have since decreased alert levels, such warming events will likely increase as global weather patterns change. 
But although this level of damage is concerning, for many scientists who spoke to the Guardian the more pressing threat is mass tourism. “Climate change happens long term,” Arias-González says. “The massive development happening right now is much more dangerous.”
“The bleaching is certainly getting worse every year,” says Vanessa Francisco, a field officer with Resiliencia, a collaboration between the United Nations Development Program and the Mexican government to strengthen natural protected areas against the effects of climate change. “But the biggest problem we have is pollution.”
The growth of mass tourism as well as farming has resulted in an increase of untreated waste and agricultural runoff on to the reef; a 2010 study found traces of raw sewage, pesticides and illicit drugs in the underground river system of Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, groundwater that would “eventually discharge into Caribbean coastal ecosystems”. A 2013 study concluded that “domestic waste management and final disposal in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras is a critical problem that needs to be addressed urgently”.
The increase in waste acts as a fertiliser to macroalgae, a kind of fleshy algae that can compete with and eventually smother or kill the corals. According to the Healthy Reef Initiative (HRI), an alliance of more than 30 organisations that monitors the Mesoamerican Reef, macroalgae cover has nearly doubled in the last 10 years across the region. This poses a serious problem because, as Francisco explains, a reef which is in a poor condition due to algae blooms is much less likely to withstand the effects of climate change: “It’s like getting a cold if you have HIV,” she says. “It reduces the reef’s resilience.” 
According to Webster, from the Coral Reef Alliance, these underwater ecosystems are highly adaptable under normal circumstances, constantly subjected to the eroding forces of storms and ocean currents. “Reefs are in a perpetual state of recovery,” he says. “A healthy reef is one that’s growing faster than it’s eroding.” A reef that is ravaged by macroalgae, however, will have a harder time bouncing back from an unseasonably warm current or a severe storm.
Mary Peter, 35, is a diving instructor in the tiny town of Xcalak, on the border between Mexico and Belize. Last year, Xcalak was hit by tropical storm Earl, the deadliest Atlantic hurricane to hit Mexico in 10 years. “It left a lot of devastation,” says Peter. “It destroyed a lot of the top reef structure. Everything was broken off; we were swimming through debris.” Six months on, however, Peter says “the reef is recovering nicely. Those chunks of coral that broke off are integrating back into the ecosystem.”
The increase in waste acts as a ​​fertiliser to macroalgae, a fleshy algae ​​that competes with and kills the corals
This kind of destruction and recovery is part of the reef’s natural ebb and flow: However, with hurricanes and storms likely to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change, the recovery process will become more difficult. When you add overfishing and pollution, the result could be devastating. “The future is going to be warmer, more disturbed, more acidic,” says Webster. “Corals are going to have to adapt. But what if they can’t? If you’re protecting the forest and you lose all the trees, it’s not a forest anymore.”
To stave off damage, scientists and nonprofit groups across the region are working with local communities to reduce overfishing, minimise pollution and strengthen the reef. “Climate change is a world issue,” says Webster. “We’re working to solve problems at a community level so we can give the reef a better chance to adapt to those global problems.”
Miguel Jarillo is a fisherman in Mexico’s Banco Chinchorro, the largest atoll in the northern hemisphere and a Unesco biosphere reserve. Ten years ago, he was trained by the World Wildlife Foundation to monitor the reef, something he has been doing ever since, providing data on the reef’s health for a number of different NGOs and conservation groups, as well as maintaining a more sustainable fishing practice. “It’s become a vice,” he says. “Going out into the sea and looking after my own resource. Because if I don’t look after it, no one else will.” 
In Belize, too, there is an increasing awareness of the reef as a vital economic resource, generating 15% of the country’s GDP. When the government began seismic tests for offshore oil near the reef last year, the outcry from the community in the tourist town of San Pedro was such that authorities shut the operation down after one day. “Without this reef, we’re just like any other Central American country,” says Elis Mei, 34, a tour operator in San Pedro. “This reef keeps our economy going. Without it, we’re done.”
There are signs that conservation efforts are paying off, albeit extremely slowly. According to HRI’s latest survey, coral cover has increased from 10% to 17.5% over the last 10 years. Herbivorous fish, which can help reduce macroalgae cover, have also increased. Five new Marine Protected Areas have been designated since 2011, meaning that the four countries now protect 20% of their territorial sea. Last year the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, designated the Mexican Caribbean biosphere reserve, a 5.75m-hectare reserve off the Yucatán peninsula.
But designating marine-protected zones only achieves so much. “Up to now, the decree is just on paper,” says HRI’s Marisol Rueda Flores, pointing out that the Mexican government has simultaneously cut funding from the body that oversees marine parks. “Mexico has some of the best laws for protecting coastal areas – the problem is no one follows them. The government has barely begun to realise the urgency of this situation.”

 Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told the Guardian that the world’s number one priority in tackling climate change must be to ensure those buildings meet higher standards of efficiency and safety.
“This would be the single most important step I want governments to take, and they can take it tomorrow,” he said. Politicians could enact higher standards in regulations immediately, though ensuring they are always enforced might take a little longer and involve cooperation between different authorities.
“There are many economic benefits to mandating standards, and this can be done by governments very easily,” said Birol. “They would have positive effects on growth, improve the conditions of the population [including their safety] and to do it they just need to make different government departments work together.”
In the developing world, and even some richer countries, building standards are often lax and frequently ignored. This has led to tragedies such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza factories in Bangladesh in 2013, which killed more than 1,100 people and injured thousands more. Just weeks ago, more than 50 people died as an illegal apartment building in Nairobi fell down.
If higher standards were enforced, not only would people benefit from greater reassurances against such needless disasters, but the buildings would use less energy and this giant source of carbon emissions would be vastly reduced, according to the IEA. Better windows, more efficient air conditioning systems, thicker walls and higher quality of materials and design would all result in efficiency savings, and make life healthier and more pleasant for the buildings’ occupants.
Birol also highlighted the need to reduce emissions from transport around the world, calling for far greater investments in electric vehicles and public transport, particularly in developing countries.
“Although there has been progress in electric cars, we are not there yet,” he said. About a million electric vehicles are now in use, showing strong growth in the past few years, but still not enough to make a real dent in transport emissions. “This is still lagging behind the Paris targets.”
In Paris last December, world governments forged a historic agreement to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, by mid-century. This will require steep emissions cuts, which were not specified in the accord, but most governments have put in place national targets running to 2025 or 2030 that will require most of the reductions experts say are needed to meet the Paris target.
Birol called on governments to provide greater incentives for key emissions-reducing technologies, such as electric vehicles, greater energy efficiency, and renewable power.
He added that technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) was running well behind where it needed to be in terms of implementation, if the Paris targets are to be met.
The technology, though technically proven and discussed for over a decade as a potential way to reduce emissions on the scale needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, is still in its infancy in terms of commercial implementation.
Last year, the UK government controversially pulled the plug on two of the world’s most promising CCS schemes. The Treasury said the £1bn price tag for a competition to prove the technology was too high, and there are now no current plans to practise CCS in the UK, a move that scientists have said risks leaving the UK running behind in the green technology economy.
The IEA report on the technologies needed to implement the Paris accord, entitled Energy Technology Perspectives: Towards Sustainable Urban Energy Systems, is published on the organisation’s website on Wednesday.

The centennial flame in Ottawa was first unveiled during celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the Canadian confederation. Initially envisioned as a temporary installation, the flame remained so popular with visitors that it has continued to burn ever since.
But the federal government has announced that it is now exploring a number of options to reduce the environmental impact of the flame, one of which includes swapping the fire with LED lights. 
A spokesperson with Public Services and Procurement Canada, the government agency tasked with overseeing the project, confirmed it is “exploring options for alternative sustainable approaches to fuel the centennial flame”.
Federal government offices have come under pressure to reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide emissions resulting from daily operations as part of the government’s climate strategy.
The flame is fueled by natural gas ferried across the country from western Canada, a region of the country where environmental groups and indigenous activists are currently protesting against pipeline expansions and carbon emissions from tar sands.
In September 2017, the government attempted to decrease the emissions of the flame by striking a “net zero” deal with Bullfrog Power, which provides gas to the flame. The energy company offsets the emissions from the flame by pumping biogas – a cleaner alternative – into its existing pipeline infrastructure in order reducing emission in a separate location. Bullfrog Power declined to comment on the extent of emissions offset by the deal which currently costs the government US$15,000 a year
The proposed change would not be the first time the monument – a circular fountain with plaques commemorating the dates each province and territory became part of Canada – has undergone a significant makeover. 
Last year, the government spent $650,000 to add an additionally territory, Nunavut, to the monument. The flame has been extinguished on a number of occasions, often the result of poor weather. In 2002, the prime minister of the day, Jean Chrétien, ordered the flame extinguished and covered to avoid damage during the G8 protests in Ottawa.

The 26-year-old from Wolverhampton, who “married into Yorkshire”, quit her job working for York council in November last year, deciding to devote herself to the cause.
Since September, when Third Energy started preparing the site at Kirby Misperton for fracking, she has been one of a group of around forty Ryedale locals to have spent almost every day protesting next to the gates to the well, holding banners and placards, and watching in dismay as lorries trundle in.
Coghill says that apart from environmental concerns, her opposition to fracking comes from a desire to protect her home. “Yorkshire is stunning,” she says. “It’s so gorgeous and I don’t think people realise that’s not a given. People don’t seem to realise that it can be taken away.” 
The business secretary, Greg Clark, is expected to give Third Energy its final permission to begin test fracking any day now, with the company saying the site is nearly ready for the process to begin. The fracking would be the first to take place in the UK since 2011, when two tremors of magnitude 1.5 and 2.3 woke people from their sleep after tests near Blackpool. If the trial run is a success, it will pave the way for the site to operate permanently. 
In a bid to stop the fracking, some campaigners have deployed non-violent direct action tactics including lying on the road to prevent vehicles from entering the site, climbing on lorries and, on one occasion recently, scaling an 18-metre (60ft) rig and waving flares. North Yorkshire police have had a permanent presence at the protest since it was scaled up in September, and accusations of disproportionate and aggressive policing are rife among campaigners. 
Officers regularly outnumber protesters by more than two to one, and the force revealed last month that the additional cost of policing the protests had been £80,238 up to 31 August and £101,476 in September alone. There have been 68 arrests and 62 charges to date.
The Guardian photographer Gary Calton wrote to the region’s police and crime commissioner last week after he was restrained by police officers twice in one day in a bid to stop him from taking pictures. “I’ve been a photographer for 27 years, photographing around the world in contentious situations, I’ve never had a police man hold my arms and stop me from working,” he said.
Carol Towner, 53, from the nearby town of Pickering, says she was charged with assaulting a police officer following a claim she had spilt hot coffee on the officer’s leg during a tussle at the gates to the well site. She denies the charge. A former Tory voter, she says she always taught her children to respect authority and the police, but has had her world view turned on its head after joining the campaign.
“Having seen the way the police have been dishing out their aggression, the way I’ve been manhandled, the way my children have been kettled … I can’t stand in my former Tory blue shoes and say that I believe in what they’re doing.”
Amanda Oliver, assistant chief constable of North Yorkshire, said the force’s duty was first and foremost to ensure the safety of everyone involved in the protest at Kirby Misperton. “This is a particularly challenging task for our officers, especially when there are large groups of people which include a mixture of peaceful protesters – the majority – along with a minority who are intent on taking unlawful action to disrupt the movement of large vehicles to and from the well site,” she said.
“This unlawful action has already caused a great deal of disruption within the local community, which is unacceptable. As well as facilitating people’s right to assemble and protest peacefully, part of our role is to keep disruption to local residents and businesses to a minimum.” She added that “the valuable role [the media plays] in covering this important issue” has been stressed to officers on the ground.
A spokesperson for Third Energy said the company respected the right to lawful and peaceful protest, but that “the residents of Ryedale and Third Energy have the same expectation that we and they should be able to go about our lawful business”.
While proponents say fracking could meet the country’s energy needs for generations and reduce its reliance on imported gas post-Brexit, campaigners argue that it is dangerous industry – citing concerns over water contamination, earth quakes and the destruction of the landscape.
Government figures out on Thursday showed public opposition to fracking was at an all-time high, with 36% opposing it, 13% supporting it, and 48% neither supporting nor opposing it. While two-thirds of England’s land is available for fracking licenses, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, France and Germany have all blocked the practice because of safety concerns.
Coghill acknowledges that she is unlikely to stop test fracking from taking place, but insists she will keep fighting the fracking industry at every corner. Kirby Misperton is the tip of the iceberg, she says. “The people who are holding out hope that this is all going to go away when the test frack is complete don’t understand what it really means for the area, and for the country.”",892,0.061167512690355336,0.07893401015228427,0.08401015228426396,2.538071065989848e-4,2.538071065989848e-4,2.538071065989848e-4,0.007868020304568528,0.5078680203045686,0.11192893401015229,0.14746192893401017,2017-11-05

ANZ announced to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that over the past month, conditions have changed such that expected costs associated with lending to the mining and resources sector would increase from a projected $800m to more than $900m.
The bank said the change was caused by the “evolving position with a small number of Australian and multi-national resources-related exposures”.
“While the overall credit environment remains broadly stable, we are continuing to see pockets of weakness associated with low commodity prices in the resources sector and in related industries,” said ANZ’s acting chief financial officer, Graham Hodges.
The bank did not disclose which companies or loans caused the writedown, but Tim Buckley, a former Citibank analyst who is now with the anti-fossil fuel Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said there were two new developments that could be linked to the move.
The first was the warning by coal giant Peabody Energy that it was on the brink of bankruptcy after finding itself unable to pay an interest payment of US$70m.
Buckley said if ANZ had lent to Peabody – which would not be known unless the company filed for bankruptcy – that would have put a dent the bank’s balance sheet.
And on Wednesday the Australian Financial Review reported the owners of a coal export facility in Queensland, WICET, was struggling with its loans because of falling coal prices, and may be seeking a debt-for-equity swap, where the company exchanges debt for a pre-determined amount of equity or stock. A report in the AFR said ANZ was set to lose money on a loan associated with WICET’s coal export facility.
Buckley said ANZ had previously been a lender to both these companies and it would not be surprising if they were still involved with them.
“These are likely two triggering events,” he said. “We know ANZ was exposed to both these corporates and both have seen defining negative financial stress events in the last week or two. Have they traded out? Who knows? That’s not public information, but we know they were exposed to both.
“I’d say this is the absolute tip of the iceberg. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested in new fossil fuel assets and infrastructure assets associated with that.” 
Buckley said the risks associated with those investments were now coming to the fore, as foreshadowed last year by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.
Julien Vincent from the financial activist group Market Forces agrees: “The coal industry is in structural decline, and it’s taking the bank industry with it, which means it’s taking shareholder value and customer value along with it.”
“It means other banks are in the same position, and there are probably a whole bunch of other debt products that haven’t been put in this category but wouldn’t be far away.
“We often think, ‘Oh look what’s happening to ANZ,’ but we’re all exposed to ANZ through our super or direct shares or by being a customer. The same goes for the other banks.”
In February Guardian Australia reported analysis showing the big four banks, including ANZ, had signed off on $5.5bn of loans to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. Many commentators have warned these assets will become “stranded” if the world moves to avoid dangerous climate change, and keeps many of the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground.",598,0.06753731343283582,0.1533582089552239,0.5376865671641791,0.019029850746268655,0.2205223880597015,3.7313432835820896e-4,3.7313432835820896e-4,3.7313432835820896e-4,3.7313432835820896e-4,3.7313432835820896e-4,2016-03-24

Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region’s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September.
Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area.
At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales – another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo – a veteran hunter.
“They’re not known by us, we don’t know too much about them,” Allooloo told the CBC.
While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters.
Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat – long prized by whalers – that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies – which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) – are also ineffective at breaking through ice.
While they don’t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches.
“Inexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,” Laforest told the CBC.
The vast area of the Arctic waters – estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species.
Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region.
In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
“I think the narwhal are scared to death,” report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.”
A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic – in numbers far greater than previously recorded.
Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed.",500,0.3151851851851852,3.703703703703704e-4,3.703703703703704e-4,0.5077777777777778,3.703703703703704e-4,0.05962962962962964,0.015185185185185184,0.015185185185185184,3.703703703703704e-4,0.08555555555555557,2018-11-05

Our experts offer seven ideas for the conservation and restoration of forests","Countries need to stop using outdated fiscal policies for agriculture. In some places, such as Brazil and Indonesia, the amount spent by their governments on subsidising agriculture is more than 100 times higher than the international funding provided to those countries for forest conservation. It sends out a contradictory message if a government is signing up to zero deforestation commitments on one hand, whilst simultaneously making deforestation more attractive to farmers.
Some countries are taking positive steps, however. Ecuador, for example, has 27 different subsidies to support palm oil production. Once they found out that some of these subsidies can harm forests, the ministers of environment and agriculture got together and agreed to review the country’s fiscal policy framework, to better align it with sustainable development. We need more of these types of holistic, coherent policy reforms. Tim Christophersen, UN-REDD team leader, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya @TimChristo
Forest dwellers are best placed be the first ones to indicate threats and call for help. In the past, radio units were installed in some indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon and they did wonders. I think the more we invest in getting low cost tech resources like this to people living in forests, the more we will get in return to fight deforestation. There are 20 million people living in the Brazilian Amazon, we should support their role in protecting their forests. They are the best park rangers as their cultures and livelihoods depend on healthy forests. Yet support rarely reaches them. Rachel Biderman, director for World Resources Institute Brazil, World Resources Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil @rachel_biderman
There is a lack of understanding about the pressures and demands being placed on forests and dialogue around alternative sustainable options. For example, we know that in sub-saharan Africa the vast majority of wood is used for household energy – this puts enormous pressure on local forests and reflects the really tough choices poor local communities have to make every day. Elsewhere the choice is often between keeping forests standing or removing them for agriculture to take place. It appears a binary choice but it should not be. Going forward we need to think about how these pressures can be best absorbed - having a full and frank dialogue with all the people involved is essential. Ian Gray, coordinator, Forest Investment Program, Washington DC, USA
It’s essential for the protection and restoration of tropical forests to actively dispute the false dichotomy between environmental stewardship and economic development. 
Even in the short term the evidence is that countries are generally much better off – in terms of the productivity of their agriculture, in terms of local environmental benefits, in terms of social justice – through well-managed land use that combines forest protection and restoration with sustainable management of forests and higher productivity agriculture, than with the model now often prevailing. 
Several governments are realising this and taking measures to change the paradigm. Brazil’s remarkable reduction in deforestation in the Amazon went hand in hand with impressive agricultural growth. Per Pharo, director, The Norwegian Climate and Forest Initiative, Oslo, Norway
If companies want to meet the zero deforestation target by 2020, they need to increase their ambitions and be more effective at implementation. They have to set up effective monitoring systems that are transparent, so consumers can hold them accountable. Governments also have a role to play in supporting companies meet these targets. For example, Brazil has a lot of data that would help companies to control their whole supply chain, but it is not available. The commercialisation of illegally sourced cattle is an example. The information that would allow companies to monitor indirect suppliers is not shared with them. Cristiane Mazzetti, Greenpeace Amazon campaigner, Greenpeace Brazil, Manaus, Brazil @crmazzet
Greenpeace has consistently provided accurate and genuine guidance
Companies need to activate partners in forested countries to closely monitor their supply chains. They cannot do it by satellite images only. NGOs, communities and indigenous groups can all help in monitoring what is going on close to the ground, but companies need to invest some money if they want the job done properly. Rachel Biderman
In a previous role I was responsible for implementing such commitments for a large multinational firm and I can tell you from direct experience the primary bottleneck is cost. Sustainable supply chains, especially in forest products, are expensive. A verified sustainable source generally costs about three times more than a traditional source. However, there are some environmental NGOs who are amazing partners in helping develop unique approaches to building sustainable forest product supply chains. Greenpeace for example, has consistently provided accurate and genuine guidance. Guardian commenter Cateernaut
Brazil has shown the effectiveness of indigenous territories in maintaining forest cover. The Xingu reserve can be seen from space! But national policy action is needed to give those territories the status of legally recognised protected areas backed up by the state. Similarly, the Katingan Project in central Kalimantan, Indonesia has been effective in controlling peat fires but in order to operate, the project needs a government permit, as well as protection from ill-thought-out national policies. Thus, local and national action should go hand-in-hand. Frances Seymour, senior fellow, Center for Global Development, Washington DC, USA @FrancesJSeymour @CGDev
Incentive-based forest protection schemes can work if the incentives are sufficiently strong. But presently there is not enough funding around for that to happen. There is also a very important question of who to incentivise. Under the UN Climate Change Convention the answer has been that countries must be incentivised because this is a public policy issue. Then countries must decide how to structure their efforts: taxes, enforcement, regulations or incentives, but most likely a mix of all. 
Deforestation is rising again in the Amazon and there is a good case to be made that this has been caused by less vigilance on enforcement, not over-reliance on incentives. Bottom line: laws and regulations that are well enforced are essential to protect forests. Without this, any incentive structure is bound to fail. Per Pharo

But we also owe it – very faint – hope | Bill McKibben,Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet. That’s all the more reason to fight on - and celebrate even the smallest successes,"There is no upside to the Trump presidency. To be in DC – I’ve come for Saturday’s giant climate march – is to be reminded up close what all Americans have known for months: we’ve put the country in the hands of a man completely unequal to the task. A man so cluelessly over his head that he keeps telling reporters he’s in over his head.
 But if you want a few grayish linings to the dark-orange cloud, you can find them. In fact, the last few days have given those of us in the climate fight a few glimmers of light.
 At midweek, and quite unexpectedly, the man who invests Harvard’s billions announced at a seminar that the world’s richest and most famous educational institution had more or less divested from fossil fuels. Of course he didn’t say that explicitly since it would require backtracking on the university’s strident declaration that it would never do such a thing. But close enough – Harvard had “paused” investing in fossil fuels, and was unlikely “ever” to resume. 
 Credit a remarkable campaign. Harvard students – like those at so many other places, including Penn and Cal where campaigners are currently sitting in –waged a relentless fight, even as officials told them no over and over again. Great credit is due them, and the alumni and faculty they enlisted. Leaders like Chloe Maxmin, who I met while she was still in high school, spent their entire college years on the fight, showing what persistence looks like.
 But they were aided, I think, by Trump’s unlikely victory. In the past, plenty of players could look for someone else to pass the buck to: surely dealing with climate change was the government’s responsibility, not Harvard’s? That was always a moral lapse, but in the Trump era it’s completely absurd. We’re ruled by a man who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese – clearly the rest of us are going to have to step up.
 And that rest of us includes Democratic politicians, too many of whom have tried to straddle the climate issue in the past. Barack Obama, remember, spent his years in office championing an “all of the above” energy policy that saw America vault past Russia and Saudi Arabia as the biggest hydrocarbon producer on the planet. But Trump throws such temporizing into sharper relief. 
That’s why Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and Bernie Sanders felt empowered Thursday to introduce legislation that, for the very first time, draws the line where it should be. Their bill demands that America move to 100% renewable energy. Not some solar panels but also some frack wells, not some windmills but also some new pipelines. 100%.
 That bill’s not going to pass anytime soon, obviously, but it is going to become the new bottom line for any serious progressive politician. Whoever leads the fight to replace Trump is going to have to do it on a platform of 100% renewable energy –and in contrast to Trump’s craziness on the issue, it will look statesmanlike instead of aspirational.
 If the capitulation of some parts of the establishment, and the invigoration of some progressive leaders, count as two small positives, there’s also a third: the unleashing of the full energy of lots and lots of people who have had to speak more softly in the past. One of the strongest voices at the ceremony launching the Merkley/Sanders bill, for instance, came from Mustafa Ali, who for many years ran the environmental justice program at EPA.
 The environmental justice program probably won’t exist much longer – the Trump EPA budget zeroes it out, which tells you all you need to know. Ali resigned – and immediately joined the staff of the HipHop Caucus, one of the most vibrant and dynamic climate justice campaigns on this particular planet. 
In his first few weeks, Ali spoke powerfully – but with a bit of the habitual reserve of the bureaucrat. By yesterday he was sounding a lot like the Rev Lennox Yearwood, the charismatic founder of the caucus: he had US senators, fists in the air, chanting “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop.”
 Which is pretty much what all of us who will march tomorrow are saying. We’re under no illusions: Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet. It’s possible the damage he’ll do will be eternal – we’re clearly on the edge of breaking the planet’s climate system. But we will fight on, looking for the holes in the Death Star.

 Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has chosen not to renew the terms of nine of the 18-member board of scientific counselors, which advises the EPA on the quality and accuracy of the science it produces. The group, largely made up of academics, is set to be replaced by representatives from industries that the EPA regulates.
 Deborah Swackhamer, chair of the board, said that with other planned departures, the panel was left with five members, including her, in the midst of an EPA hiring freeze.
 “The committee has been eviscerated,” she told the Guardian. “We assumed these people would be renewed and there was no reason or indication they wouldn’t be. These people aren’t Obama appointees, they are scientific appointees. To have a political decision to get rid of them was a shock.”
 The nine departing members – who worked on matters including toxic water pollution, climate change and chemical safety – all completed three-year terms. The decision to not renew those terms has opened the way for the Trump administration to refashion the scientific board in line with its industry-friendly agenda that has sought to strip away various pollution rules in the name of “regulatory certainty”.
A spokesman for the agency told the New York Times: “The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community.”
There would be a morality issue if the committee is turned into a political pawn of a certain viewpoint
 This could lead to multiple instances of conflicts of interest, Swackhamer said, despite clear EPA ethics rules. 
“If you have industry hand-picked people,” she said, “the concern would be that they would have a frequent conflict because we discuss areas that touch upon big industry.
 “This administration has made statements not terribly favourable to science. There would be a morality issue if the committee is turned into a political pawn of a certain viewpoint. Our credibility would be destroyed. We would be seen within the scientific community as tainted.”
Courtney Flint, a board member and professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University, said she was told on Friday her term would not be renewed.
“This came as a surprise as I had been told that the appointment would be renewed,” she told the Guardian, adding that the board “has been careful to avoid partisanship in our scientific recommendations”.
“I am hopeful that this advisory work can continue to be done by objective scientific experts that represent a cross-section of societal voices to inform policy.” 
 Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA multiple times over its pollution rules, has criticized the science produced by the agency to support its regulations. 
In March, Pruitt reversed a move to ban chlorpyrifos, a widely used pesticide, despite the advice of EPA scientists that it could be harmful to children and farm workers. Pruitt said: “We are returning to using sound science in decision-making, rather than predetermined results.”
John O’Grady, president of a union that represents more than 9,000 EPA employees, said he was concerned that the agency would now be “repopulated with scientists who operate within the realm of opinion, rather than fact”. 
“We are already aware of the opinion of this administration and Mr Pruitt with respect to climate change,” he said. “However, opinions are neither fact nor theory and do not belong to the realm of science.
“Without independence and sound peer review of the science conducted by the agency, it will be impossible to distinguish between good science and bad science at the US EPA.”
 Republicans have complained about the EPA’s scientific advisory board, claiming that it is too heavily weighted in favour of academics who support regulation. 
In February, Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee, said: “The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government. The conflict of interest here is clear.”
 Members of the board, however, deny that they are politically motivated, pointing to the ethics training and vetting they receive, similar to that undergone by career public servants.
Swackhamer said: “We have spirited conversations about the science – we don’t just rubber-stamp what the EPA wants to do. These people are valuable, highly qualified and highly vetted. It’s troubling that political considerations have come into this.”
In a statement to the Guardian, an EPA spokesman said: “EPA received hundreds of nominations to serve on the board, and we want to ensure fair consideration of all the nominees – including those nominated who may have previously served on the panel – and carry out a competitive nomination process.”",793,2.617801047120419e-4,2.617801047120419e-4,2.617801047120419e-4,0.013350785340314135,0.10759162303664922,0.18089005235602093,2.617801047120419e-4,2.617801047120419e-4,0.581413612565445,0.11544502617801047,2017-05-08

Clean energy is the future for America and the planet | Rahwa Ghirmatzion and Mark Ruffalo,"Across America, families, businesses, churches and other community groups are turning their back on fossil fuels – for good. There is no going back now","Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris climate agreement and turn his back on the other 194 countries that signed it leaves him isolated on the world stage. But Trump is also isolated from the very Americans he purports to lead, and here lies hope.
Across America, families, businesses, churches, institutions and governments are busy building a clean energy future. And no president can stop that.
When he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Accord, Trump said: “I was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” And that prompted the mayor of Pittsburgh to join other American mayors – more than 100 so far – in affirming his city’s commitment to move to 100% renewable energy. 
This reflects the fact that the people of Pittsburgh – and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Salt Lake City and towns and rural areas across America – want clean energy in their backyards. In liberal areas and conservative ones, Americans are transforming the way they power their lives as we move to 100% clean energy for all.
Consider Buffalo, in upstate New York. Once an industrial powerhouse dotted with manufacturing and steel mill factories, it lost half its population in the second half of the 20th century and became the third-poorest big city in the United States. 
It is home to exactly the kind of “forgotten” people Trump talked about on the campaign trail. In a city featuring old houses and tough winters, heating bills regularly cost more than rent for some. But in a once blighted area on the West Side, hundreds of residents are working with Push Buffalo – an organization Rahwa helps run – to weatherproof homes, install solar energy systems and build a stronger community, all while training local residents for good jobs in the emerging green economy.
On the other side of the country, California’s Asian Pacific Environmental Network organized in eight different languages, from Korean to Cantonese, to secure $2bn for solar development in low-income housing projects. 
And in South Los Angeles, a community group called Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education – Scope – is helping black, Latino and low-income communities of color take advantage of economic and job opportunities in the growing clean-energy economy.
But it’s not just city communities that are building a clean energy future that has the power to blunt the worst effects of climate change. So are rural American states, including states whose people voted for Trump. 
Iowa produced over 36% of its electricity from wind power last year – a bigger share than any other state. South Dakota gets almost 70% of its electricity from water and wind. In Kansas, wind energy has grown from less than 1% of the state’s electricity generation in 2005 to 24% in 2015.
American businesses get it, too. Just ask Boeing, whose South Carolina airplane factory is powered by 100% renewable energy. Walmart, General Motors and other major US corporations are major customers for renewable power.
In our work with the Solutions Project and Push Buffalo, we have seen how clean and efficient energy projects are everywhere, from universities to churches, from factories to farms and from military bases to shopping malls.
Combatting climate change is an important motivation for many of these efforts. But we’ve seen that even Americans who don’t “believe” in climate change are embracing renewable energy. Some of them value cleaner air; others value energy independence and national security and others are called to care for creation.
Simplifying it all is the economics: as renewables become as affordable as fossil fuels – and even more affordable – they become more common, and economies of scale make them cheaper still.
And people in America are not only embracing these lower bills. They are embracing community ownership of renewable energy infrastructure, creating good local jobs and building local wealth. Their vision is to transform America’s energy economy from a draining and extractive model to a regenerative and sustainable model that makes communities – and the nation – stronger.
Time and again, Donald Trump has promised to help forgotten, hard-hit Americans. But trying to hold back the rising tide of clean energy will not help them – and it won’t work, anyway. If Trump truly cared about making life better for the people he was elected to lead, he would join his fellow Americans – and the rest of the world – in building a prosperous, sustainable clean energy future.
The people of this country will keep helping themselves – to renewable energy. They are putting this country and their communities first, in a way that also serves the planet. The US and the rest of the world will continue our historic march to clean energy for all – no matter who’s in the White House.

As the impacts of climate change are being felt more forcefully around the world, it is vital that prominent public institutions like the British Museum play their part in minimising the environmental impacts of their activities.
BP’s sponsorship contract with the museum is coming to an end this year. While governments in Paris committed to transition away from fossil fuels, BP remains a barrier to progress. It is working to extract new sources of carbon-intensive oil from the tar sands, the Arctic and under the oceans, when we need to keep at least two thirds of known fossil fuels in the ground. BP’s business plan is incompatible with a stable climate, and the company is using its influence to lobby against effective climate policies.
Meanwhile, its operations are affecting lives and livelihoods across the world. The company was recently hit with the biggest criminal fine in US history for its gross negligence in causing the Deepwater Horizon spill.
To receive sponsorship from BP is to condone these business practices. Retaining such an unethical sponsor would seriously damage the British Museum’s reputation, and place it firmly on the wrong side of history. Indeed, Tate and BP have just parted company after 26 years, following intensifying protests and criticism. We urge Dr Fischer to follow Tate’s lead in not renewing this contract, and to seek funding from sources more in line with the museum’s values and what is needed to ensure a stable future.Professor Anne Glover Vice-principal external affairs, University of Aberdeen, former chief scientific adviser to the European CommissionMargaret Atwood WriterMark Ruffalo ActorMark Rylance ActorDr Jane Goodall DBE Founder the Jane Goodall Institute, and UN messenger of peaceSir Tom Kibble Emeritus professor of physics, Imperial College LondonNaomi Klein Author, activist and film-makerJeremy Leggett Author, solar entrepreneur and advocateRichard Horton Editor-in-chief, The LancetSimon Lewis Professor of global change science at UCLEmma Thompson ActorNaomi Oreskes Professor of the history of science, HarvardMark Goldring Chief executive, Oxfam GBDr Nick Winterbotham Director, BTC &amp;

The initiative, which roams from Arctic protection to plugging methane emissions from oil wells and pipelines to decarbonisation of the US and Canadian economies in the second half of this century, cements a new climate change partnership between neighbours after 15 years of pulling in opposite directions.
It signals once again that Obama intends to keep pushing hard on climate change in what was supposed to be the lame duck phase of his presidency.
And it improves the prospects of rallying countries to ratify the Paris climate agreement when it opens for signing on 22 April. The agreement needs to be signed by 55 countries responsible for 55% of global emissions to come into force.
“The United States and Canada are fully united in combatting climate change,” Obama told a press conference at the White House on Thursday. “We are focusing on making sure the Paris agreement is fully implemented.”
Trudeau agreed, describing the Paris agreement as an action plan, and the US and Canadian leaders as key players in ensuring its success.
“That agreement is both a symbolic declaration of global cooperation on climate change as well a practical guide for growing our economies in a responsible and sustainable way,” he told the press conference. “We know that our international partners expect and, indeed, need leadership from us on this issue.”
The US and Canada were committed to signing the Paris agreement as soon as possible, Trudeau went on, a move which could help the United Nations reach its goal of ratifying the agreement in 2016, before Obama leaves the White House.
Thursday’s declaration marks the first time in 15 years that US and Canadian leaders have been in sync on climate change.
George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto climate accords when he came to the White House in 2001. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, also withdrew from the agreement and pushed aggressively the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have ramped up production from the carbon-heavy Alberta tar sands.
The two leaders began their relationship with some friction, with Obama cancelling the Keystone XL project  last November, days after Trudeau took office. The Canadian leader did not protest, however.
But with the declaration of a shared vision on climate change, Trudeau is now cast as Obama’s heir – in terms of pressing for global actions.
 Once Obama leaves the White House, it will fall to Trudeau to maintain continuity of a North American climate plan should a Democrat takes the White House, or to help to keep the flame alive in the event a Republican wins the election and follows through on threats to overturn Obama’s policies. 
The concern for Obama’s long-term climate legacy was inherent in Thursday’s declaration, with the US and Canada pledging to deliver plans for decarbonising the post-2050 economy by the end of 2016. 
The neighbours also pledged to lobby other G20 countries to produce their long-term climate plans – a move which could boost international confidence that the Paris agreement is indeed putting the global economy on a low-carbon trajectory.
That could help box in Obama’s successor – from either party – making it difficult to overturn the Paris agreement without the risk of antagonising an important ally and neighbour.
The joint commitment to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% from 2012 by 2025 will have the most immediate impact in helping the US and Canada to hit the emissions reductions targets they offered at Paris.
Emissions from methane – a far more powerful climate pollutant than carbon dioxide – rose rapidly with the boom in fracking.
Campaigners had been pressing Obama to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells – not just future projects, warning the US had no chance of hitting its Paris targets without such measures.
Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, agreed, telling a White House conference call with reporters: “We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources.”
The campaign group Earthworks, which has used infrared imaging to map methane leaks, said the new methane initiative was a significant step-up in Obama’s efforts to cap emissions from oil and gas wells. “With today’s announcement, President Obama starts to get serious,” the organisation said in a statement.
But it was on the global arena, where Obama played a critical role in nudging countries towards the Paris agreement, where the renewed US-Canadian partnership on climate change could have the most impact.
“On the big looming issues on the horizon, it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are, the more we can shape the international agenda to meet these challenges,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.”
He suggested that having Trudeau on side with the two leaders’ shared liberal values would help drive solutions to help poor countries deal with climate change. 
“If we don’t agree, if we’re not aggressive, if we’re not far-sighted, if we don’t pool our resources around the research and development and clean energy agenda that’s required to solve this problem, then other countries won’t step up and it won’t get solved,” Obama said. “That’s a really important effort.” 
The two leaders also pledged to secure a deal cutting emissions from commercial air planes through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is based in Montreal. 
They committed to raise fuel economy standards for delivery trucks and buses, and to work to get more solar and wind power on the US and Canadian electrical grids.
On the Arctic, the two leaders pledged to take “science-based standards” into account for any future oil and gas drilling. 
Noting the rapid disappearance of the sea ice cover, the US and Canada also committed to reduce the use of heavy fuel oil, set up low-impact shipping lanes, and work for sustainable commercial fishing. 
Obama and Trudeau will have another chance to work on Arctic protections at a White House summit in the autumn and, as officials made clear in a conference call, he has no intention of reining back on climate activism any time soon. 
The president will seek out climate partnerships with other countries in the remaining months, John Morton, an adviser, told reporters. “I can tell you we are working actively on ensuring that in final year of the administration we see continued progress bilaterally and multilaterally,” he told a conference call.",1076,0.015458015267175572,0.16431297709923662,0.00400763358778626,1.9083969465648855e-4,1.9083969465648855e-4,1.9083969465648855e-4,0.4391221374045801,1.9083969465648855e-4,0.37614503816793893,1.9083969465648855e-4,2016-03-11

As well as limiting carbon emissions, we must adapt","Dramatic increases in the rate at which ice on Greenland and East Antarctica is melting are, along with the heatwave gripping Australia, among the latest manifestations of the changes our planet and its atmosphere are undergoing. Concerns surrounding the risk of melting ice causing sea levels to rise were previously focused mainly on large glaciers. But scientists have discovered that the largest recent losses from Greenland’s vast ice sheet, which is two miles thick in places, have occurred in the island’s largely glacier-free south-west. Combined with recent analysis of retreating Antarctic glaciers that were previously thought to be stable, this new research makes unnerving reading. This is because of what it tells us about the extent of likely sea level rises, and warming seas linked to coral die-off and chaotic weather, but also because it highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the climate system.
Last year the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to work towards the most ambitious targets in the 2015 Paris agreement, and a global temperature rise not greater than 1.5C. Many experts fear that factors including the election of Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil mean that even the more modest goal of sticking to current commitments, putting the world on course for a 3C rise, remains a huge challenge. Currently, global carbon emissions are still rising. But if people all over the world are getting used to the idea that higher temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events are the new normal – recent polling in the US suggests 72% of Americans believe global warming is important, the highest-ever figure – we are arguably less advanced in our understanding of warming oceans.
The sea level rises that scientists expect to accompany a temperature rise of 3C would submerge cities including Shanghai, Osaka and Miami along with parts of Rio de Janeiro and Alexandria – less than a century from now. Among nations, Bangladesh will be particularly severely affected, with one estimate suggesting that 250,000 people are already forced to move each year, making them environmental refugees. Such facts on the ground, as well as predictions, are why climate activists have long linked their cause to wider concerns around social justice. Just as carbon emissions must be limited to protect the livelihoods of people already struggling in areas vulnerable to drought and desertification, sea level rises must be restricted to protect the millions of people who live on coasts and in low-lying areas. The movement of peoples around the world, including but not limited to refugees, is in some cases a direct consequence of changes to the environment.
Weather and climate systems are complex, and sea levels are hard to predict confidently. Already, ice sheets and glaciers are surprising scientists by behaving in unexpected ways. But while trying to limit future emissions remains the most pressing task, these ominous findings highlight the need to address the consequences of carbon already emitted. Sea level rises will continue long after emissions have peaked. We will have to adapt to our world’s changing shape.",509,0.5177606177606178,3.861003861003861e-4,3.861003861003861e-4,3.861003861003861e-4,3.861003861003861e-4,0.1586872586872587,0.27837837837837837,0.03127413127413127,3.861003861003861e-4,0.011969111969111969,2019-01-22

The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society. 
It’s tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural. 
While these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues. 
The title of the article, “Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years” clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region.
The authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled. 
The Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey).
What did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past. 
In the Levant region, the recent drought (1998–2012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years.
Here is what Dr. Cook told me: 
To really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region.
To be clear, this study doesn’t prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn’t prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context. 
We know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences.
Was the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not.

In order to deliver clean, affordable electricity we need to change our undemocratic system of supply","We are on course for a climate catastrophe. 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record. Unless the Paris agreement’s target of limiting the rise in temperatures by 1.5C is met, heatwaves like that in 2003, which killed tens of thousands of people in Europe, will become the norm. And that is before considering rising sea levels and desertification that will sink cities, and kill and displace millions, or the fact that the Earth has already lost half its wildlife in the past 40 years.
The task for politicians is to propose real solutions to the single most important issue facing humanity. Too often, the environment is considered a matter for scientists, enthusiasts and activists. To increase public understanding and energise the political debate, we need more than facts – we need a programme that resonates with people’s everyday experiences, offering not just warnings but opportunities and improvement. 
No issue better connects the environment to people’s lives than energy. In Britain today, seven million households struggle to pay their bills because of spiralling costs, while the big six energy companies have seen their profits rise by more than tenfold since 2007. The energy market is not just expensive, inefficient and polluting – it is, above all, undemocratic.
In order to deliver clean, affordable heating and electricity we need to change the whole system of energy supply. When energy is driven by the needs of people, it will be greener – because saving the planet is in the interests of everyone.
That is why I am today announcing a bold new set of policies which will pioneer a democratic, community-led system of energy supply. Over the course of the next parliament, we will use public investment and legislation to promote the creation of over 200 local energy companies, giving towns, cities and localities the powers they need to drive a clean, locally accountable energy system with public, not-for-profit companies.
At the heart of this policy will be a new generation of community energy co-operatives. We will create 1,000 of these co-operatives with the support of a network of regional development banks, and legislate to give them the right to sell energy directly to the communities they serve. 
At the same time as building a new publicly run, locally accountable energy system, we will invest in the high quality homes and insulation needed to make Britain environmentally sustainable. We will create a National Home Insulation programme to insulate at least 4m homes to energy efficiency standard B or C. In the private rented sector, we will set compulsory standards at the same level and end the misery of cold rented accommodation. This would save millions of people money on their bills as well as saving energy that is currently wasted on poorly insulated homes.
In order to have any hope of keeping the rise in temperature to 2C – let alone meeting our Paris agreement target of 1.5C – we need to keep 80% of fossil fuels in the ground. This can and must be done. Scotland is already on course to generate 100% of its electricity from renewables, and Britain has an ample supply of wind and water. In government, I will commit to generating 65% of Britain’s electricity from these sources by 2030.
All of these measures will create secure, skilled employment for hundreds of thousands of people. As part of our transition to a low-carbon economy, we estimate that we will create 316,000 jobs in wind, solar and wave power. We will use a £500bn national investment programme, with a National Investment Bank and a network of regional development banks, to ensure that these jobs and opportunities are created in places where they are most needed – in coastal towns and areas with high unemployment.
Too often, environmental catastrophe is explained in the same terms as an asteroid hitting the earth. But the problems and the solutions are political – they are about the prioritisation of profit over the needs of people and, at the heart of it all, a lack of democracy in how decisions are made. By democratising our energy supply, and giving people power over their own destinies, we can rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind.",703,0.07310126582278481,0.37373417721518987,0.12373417721518988,3.1645569620253165e-4,3.1645569620253165e-4,3.1645569620253165e-4,0.13322784810126584,0.1300632911392405,3.1645569620253165e-4,0.164873417721519,2016-09-07

Doing so would save countless lives globally,"It is the greatest environmental hazard of the age. Nothing focuses our concern for the future more, divides rich and poor, exercises science, business, politicians, old and young. It is an existential threat, a generational battle. All political and financial resources must be concentrated on stopping climate change.
But now that governments have signed up to the unambitious Paris climate agreement and pledged to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, we must ask whether we have lost sight of everything else. Is the environment just about carbon and parts per million of gases in the atmosphere? What about the environment that we can smell, see and touch today?
For 20 years or more concerns about nuclear waste, food production, the quality of river water, the health of our soils and seas, the fate of our forests, the impact of road-building and many other important ecological issues have been steadily marginalised, starved of resources or pushed off the agenda by climate change.
Climate has become for government an excuse to build nuclear power and ditch other green policies. Money for biodiversity has been slashed, planning laws revoked, pollution and waste controls weakened and sustainable development policies rejected. Most popular and ministerial attention has been focused on energy companies and big carbon polluters, and the wider environment has visibly deteriorated. Seeing trees as sticks of carbon, air as gas, or forests as sinks is abstract, esoteric and emotionally stultifying.
Most heinous of all the sins of emissions is what has happened to our air quality since climate change climbed the political agenda 20 years ago. No government wants us to know that far more people will suffer grievous illnesses and will die from the filthy air shrouding our cities than from any warming of the atmosphere in the next 30 years. Climate change may give us a glimpse of the terrifying future we are heading towards if we don’t change our ways, but toxic air is already here, and killing us in ever greater numbers.
New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organisation state that between 5.5 and 7 million people die from air pollution every year. That’s more than die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together; more than the population of Scotland. In the next 10 years we can expect as many people to die from breathing poisonous air as were killed in the second world war.
Most of those deaths will be in China and India which, in the name of extreme poverty eradication, have been transforming their cities and are now having to pay for a health crisis of their own making. But we in rich countries do not have the same excuses. Our industries and governments have known for well over a century the health effects of polluted air. Yet they have fought in Europe to be allowed to continue polluting, and people have been encouraged to switch to diesel and more polluting fuels because they emit less CO2.
In Britain, 29,000 people die a year from breathing in particles of unburned carbon and construction dust, and an estimated 23,500 more as a result of nitrogen dioxide. To condone these deaths is unforgivable; to actively seek to carry on polluting is like declaring war on the public. It’s saying, “We know that the whole of Christchurch or half the city of Worcester will be asphyxiated next year, but there is nothing we think we should do about it.”
It’s a case of looking after the green pennies while the green pounds take care of themselves
But those 50,000 or more deaths a year are just the tip of the iceberg, hiding hospital wards full of people with heart disease, cancers and respiratory and lung problems caused by lifetimes spent breathing toxic air. No one counts the heartbreak when parents die young, or when children are unable to breathe properly or when Granny develops dementia – which is now linked to air pollution too.
Nor does government want us to tell us how much air pollution really costs. This is reckoned by the European environment agency to be over £10bn a year in damage to people’s health, buildings, soil and water. That is dozens of new hospitals and schools, thousands of extra nurses and teachers, and enough left over to protect most of Britain’s premier conservation sites.
After 20 years of battling to get government to take the climate seriously, we must wake up to the fact that the very air we breathe is killing us and making us bankrupt, yet governments are deliberately making the situation worse. Despite the Volkswagen scandal – the German car giant admitted that it cheated emissions tests in the US – new pollution limits for diesel cars have been delayed until 2019.
On the drawing board in Britain are a new runway and hundreds of thousands more planes every year in the southeast, a massive national road-building programme, several new road crossings for east London taking air pollution into the heart of some of the poorest areas, the £50bn HS2 rail line, fracking, giant infrastructure projects from nuclear power stations and new ports. All will add to air pollution and to climate emissions.
The government has developed tunnel vision. Because it sees environmental problems as many separate issues, it does not understand the links between them and the benefits of addressing them together. Yet the science shows that if air pollution is addressed, there will be a significant decrease in climate emissions. Restoring peat bogs and investing in conservation will not only improve biodiversity, reduce flooding and make for a healthier environment, it will also reduce greenhouse gases.
We have been distracted by climate change and have let governments dictate the agenda. Now we must return to basics, and address all those issues that have been conveniently dropped. Who will get angry about the degradation of water quality, the plague of plastic in our seas? Mining? What about computer and smart phone waste? Litter? Population control? Endangered species? Unless we address mass consumption – the root of our environmental crisis – climate change will not only worsen, we will be left with a degraded world.
Rather than solely trying to tackle the vast problem of climate change, we must address all the many factors which make it worse. It’s a case of looking after the green pennies and letting the green pounds take care of themselves.",1044,0.03158995815899582,0.18430962343096235,0.23033472803347282,0.17594142259414228,2.0920502092050213e-4,2.0920502092050213e-4,0.15292887029288704,0.027405857740585775,2.0920502092050213e-4,0.19686192468619249,2016-02-20

Earlier this month, France announced that it wanted to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040, joining India (2030) and Norway (2025) in envisioning an all-electric future.
Car-makers are racing to meet demand, with Volvo promising that from 2019, all of its new models will feature an electric motor. 
Modern electric motors are compact, extremely efficient and emissions-free at the point of use but each one requires a battery to store and deliver power, and that is where electric vehicles (EVs) stumble.
Most EVs today use lithium ion battery packs, the same technology that powers smartphones, tablets and laptops. Lithium ion packs for electric cars have fallen in price by about 80% since 2010, according to consulting firm McKinsey, but they remain expensive. 
A replacement battery pack for GM’s Chevrolet Bolt is priced at more than $15,700 (£12,150) – representing over 40% of the cost of the entire vehicle. It could take a decade or more for EVs to drop to the price of petrol car, says McKinsey.
While electric motors are much more efficient than internal combustion engines, batteries can store only a small fraction of the energy in fossil fuels. Some of today’s EVs can run out of juice in as little as 100 miles.
Finally, while lithium ion batteries are not as explosive as petrol, they do have safety issues. They require cooling to keep from over-heating and contain flammable liquid electrolytes that readily ignite if the battery is damaged. 
“For EVs, you have to consider cost, energy density, and safety,” says Jun Liu, a materials scientist at the US Department of Energy and director of Battery500, a $50m effort to improve lithium ion batteries, backed by Tesla and US tech giant IBM. “All three things are very important.”
The 500 in Battery500’s name refers to its goal of doubling the energy density of batteries, typically 250 Watt hours per kilogram today. In the short term, says Liu, that means optimising current technologies, and building more large-scale facilities like Tesla’s Gigafactory, now taking shape in the Nevada desert. 
“Costs could come down drastically just with the scale of manufacturing,” says Liu. Tesla alone wants to build three more Gigafactories around the world, each one capable of churning out as many lithium ion batteries in a year as the entire world did in 2013.
The next step would be to replace the graphite anodes in today’s batteries with electrodes made of silicon. Silicon can store much more charge than graphite but expands and shrinks when charging and discharging, and can react with and use up the electrolyte. These problems cause experimental silicon anode batteries to fail much sooner than those made with graphite. 
Solving these issues could take five years, but should boost energy densities to 350 Watt hours per kilogram, thinks Liu. However, he admits lithium batteries with enough energy density to double the range of cars are still at least a decade away.
That should not prevent people from seriously considering EVs today, says Jessika Trancik, an energy studies professor at MIT. 
Her research has shown that some of cheapest EVs, such as the Nissan Leaf or Ford Focus Electric, can already meet 90% of people’s daily driving needs while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 30% or more.
“The challenge is getting people over their range anxiety,” she says. “When they’re buying a new car they want to know that it’s going to get them where they need on that one day of the year they drive a very long distance. Extending the charging infrastructure, or embracing new business models like car sharing, could solve the problem of EV adoption a lot quicker than developing new batteries.”",622,0.03651315789473684,0.3358552631578947,0.5924342105263157,3.289473684210526e-4,3.289473684210526e-4,0.0036184210526315794,3.289473684210526e-4,0.0036184210526315794,3.289473684210526e-4,0.026644736842105263,2017-07-19

This summer a rocky, potentially Earth-like planet called Proxima b was found orbiting the nearest star to our sun at a distance where liquid water could exist on its surface. Some have mooted it might be habitable. What do you think?I’d say we need to know a little bit more about nearby planets, like Mars, and some nearby moons within our solar system, like Europa around Jupiter or [Saturn’s] Enceladus. These have tantalising properties that could support life as we know it, but in its extremes – extreme cold, extreme dehydration or extreme radiation. And if we find life in our solar system, that bodes very well for life being ubiquitous. Then practically any planet we find that has been around long enough, we’d go there expecting to find life rather than simply wondering if it is there.
Obama says we will put a man on Mars under a president yet to be determined with a budget not yet established
President Obama has reiterated the goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and to bring them back. That seems ambitious, to say the least…I am critical of it in a different way. Obama is saying we will put a man on Mars in 2030, under the leadership of a president yet to be determined, on a budget line not yet established. I like that somebody is dreaming that way, but I don’t know the cost to him of making that promise. So I have my scepticism that it would actually come to pass.
Should we go back to the moon first?I think we should remind ourselves how to go to the moon, but I think Mars is vastly more interesting, biologically, because it has evidence of liquid, running water – it’s had water for billions of years. I’ve always wanted to keep Mars in our sights, even if we do choose to go back to the moon.
Would you go to Mars?I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother first! I am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done before, but I am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do take those risks. We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as that.
Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never been done before, not with people – it is expensive and it has unquantified risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to Mars, SpaceX and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it. Their business model is selling to the government.
There is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the universe; there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes. What’s your bet?I like it all. If Earth is any kind of example at all, then most life you’ll find would be microbial. But consider also that if you can make a robot that knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to three other planets, you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short amount of time.
Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have voiced concerns about AI. How about you?I am completely relaxed. I would claim that AI will rise up, solving bits of challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort of stunning application of computers in the service of human need. Is a self-driving car going to stand up, wield a weapon and shoot you? No!
Given how we have managed to damage the Earth, should we be looking for other places to live?If you want to ship a billion people to Mars and have them live there as they are living on Earth, you’ll have to terraform Mars – and that means turning Mars into an oasis of some kind. If you had the power of geoengineering to terraform Mars into Earth, then you have the power of geoengineering to turn Earth back into Earth. So the argument that if we trash Earth we need another planet doesn’t work. I am not convinced that escaping Earth and leaving others behind to die is the most sensible solution out there.
With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn't, is to vote them out of office
With the Paris agreement, have climate change sceptics finally been overcome? Are we all on the same page?I tweeted a couple of weeks ago something that seemed to resonate with people. It was something like: “Personal truths are established by faith, objective truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by incessant repetition.” So you can make anything true that you want, as long as you repeat it all the time. So Trump keeps calling her “Crooked Hillary”. That’s just part of her new name now – the first bit is Crooked, her second name is Hillary. You repeat this often enough and then you go interview Trump supporters and they say: “Well, she’s crooked.” A new political truth has arisen simply by repetition. With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn’t, is to vote them out of office.
What do you think of the candidates?Again I have a slightly different view. You’ll never see me complaining about someone who is running for office. Never. The issue is not who is running, or even what their thoughts are. The issue is that your fellow citizens are thinking one way versus another in the elections. So if you don’t like Trump, your gripe is not with Trump – he’s just a person. Your gripe is with the 40% of the electorate that wants to vote for him. That’s who you should be talking to. If people think they are voting in their own interests – but are not – then they need to be trained how to think about claims made by politicians.
You roasted rapper BoB over his claims about a flat Earth on Twitter...There are too many people out there to waste that kind of energy on, so why was he different? Because he has millions of Twitter followers and he invoked physics to show the Earth was flat. Well, those are fighting words, so then I looked at the tweets where he said he’d got physics and then I posted my tweets saying you need some more physics. And then I showed people how to calculate it all and where he went wrong. But I would rather train people to think straight in the first place than fix them later, when it is sometimes too late.
You’ve said you are “simultaneously flattered and disturbed when, after posting various tweets, people tweet back wondering if I’m on drugs”. Is that just because your tweets reflect mind-bending thoughts about the universe?The thoughts I have every day are the kind of thoughts others might only have in a bar, in a pub after a couple of beers when they are contemplating their existence, but we do this all the time in astrophysics.
In the UK, in the wake of Brexit, there has been a lot of talk of being in a “post-truth” environment. How do you feel about that?If that is how you feel, then that is the beginning of the end of an informed democracy. Watch other countries rise up as you not only lag but regress. All the growth economies will be elsewhere because innovation and science and technology and investments in what are objectively truths are the foundations of tomorrow’s economies. If you reject it then you will be forfeiting everything that such a great nation has worked so hard to obtain. My point is that if you do not embrace objective truths, just move back to the caves, that is where you’re going to be eventually.

A leaked document shows that BusinessEurope, Europe’s biggest business lobbying group, will urge members to oppose any moves by the European Commission to ratchet up the bloc’s 2030 targets for clean energy, carbon cuts and energy efficiency.
The commission is considering whether to set more ambitious goals in November after a key international science panel report on meeting tougher global warming targets is published in October, and before a UN climate summit in December.
But, at meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, BusinessEurope will ask big companies to agree a “line to take” on the prospect of steeper carbon cuts. If the commission’s measures have teeth, the group’s “advocacy and communication strategy” recommends companies agree to fight them. “To oppose the new increase of ambition, using the usual arguments of global playing field, we cannot compensate for others, etc,” the document said.
If the commission opts for warm words and a political statement rather than a material ratcheting up of the targets, the group suggests it should react by being “rather positive”.
BusinessEurope’s members include household names in the energy and technology sectors, many of which have spoken of the need for strong action on climate change.
When contacted by the Guardian to ask if they agreed or disagreed with the lobby group’s suggested opposition, UK business trade body the CBI, German conglomerate Siemens, French energy firms Engie and EDF Energy, and Japanese multinational Hitachi all failed to distance themselves from the proposal.
Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft, all of which source renewable energy and have stressed the importance of cutting emissions, also failed to comment on where they stood on the proposal.
A CBI spokesperson said the group “has always been supportive of the ambitious and challenging climate targets set by the EU and the UK”. BusinessEurope said the meeting was a starting point to discuss what its position should be.
Kate Blagojevic, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace, which obtained the leaked document, said: “This powerful industry lobby is busy plotting behind the scenes to derail further action from the EU ahead of a major climate summit.”
Blagojevic said she was surprised companies appeared willing to go along with the proposal and urged them to “reject this cynical plan and use Wednesday’s meeting to stop it in its tracks”.
EU energy chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, said in August that the commission was weighing up whether or not to increase the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 2030 from 40% to 45%.
The plan has the support of the commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who has said that he shared Cañete’s conclusions on the carbon target. “This summer’s droughts are a stark reminder – not only for farmers – of just how important that work is to safeguard the future for generations of Europeans. We cannot turn a blind eye to the challenge in front of our noses,” Juncker said this month.",501,3.921568627450981e-4,0.13372549019607843,0.13372549019607843,3.921568627450981e-4,0.23176470588235296,3.921568627450981e-4,0.43176470588235294,3.921568627450981e-4,0.02784313725490196,0.0396078431372549,2018-09-18

“That just isn’t true,” Lakoff says. “People think in terms of conceptual structures called frames and metaphors. It’s not just the facts.”
Compelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts – that’s the way to talk about global warming.
Earlier this year the UN released a handbook for talking about climate change which recommends “telling a human story, talking about the real world, knowing what matters to the audience, and employing visual aids”.
This advice takes advantage of processes that are literally hardwired in our brains and have assisted with our survival. Or, as moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt said, the “human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor”.
You don’t have to look far to find these stories.
Tell your family about the joint US and Australian firefighting efforts that have been running for 20 years but may be stopped because we are moving towards a “year round” fire season and will be too busy battling blazes at home to help anyone else.
The process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge
Tell them about the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which could hit again next year with heat waves breaking records that have stood for 118 years by more than 5C.
Tell them about the low-lying island nations like Kiribati, which are being threatened by storm surges and rising sea levels, and then show them this picture.
If you need something festive perhaps mention that summer heat waves have destroyed one third of the Christmas tree crops in the UK, something already well known in Australia.
If you do have to quote facts and figures, use graphs to bring them to life. These animated charts of global temperature over time are compelling and this collection of 10 graphs is a little dated but still worth bookmarking.
Chances are you’re not going to meet outright deniers this Christmas. The overwhelming majority of people believe in global warming – 73% of the Australian public at last count.
The problem is urgency. So make your conversations about the tangible present with solutions. This might mean talking about smaller things first so it doesn’t sound so big and difficult to deal with that it is overwhelming.
Talk about the droughts across Australia. The fires in Queensland and California. The increased severity of storms and hurricanes such as those that hit Florida and Houston or the single cyclone that wiped out more than 60% of Vanuatu’s economy.
Keep things real, immediate, and tangible.
In the case that you do run into deniers, or denialist rhetoric, it’s important to resist the urge to repeat false claims while attempting to refute them.
I’ve written before about the downsides of acting as a publicist for views you disagree with. In short, it’s counterproductive and usually ends up strengthening the other side’s arguments. You want to avoid repeating claims – but by all means refute them forcefully. 
An example of this would be if someone raises scientific consensus. You say “more scientists agree on global warming than on plate tectonics” but don’t repeat whatever claim has prompted this.
Then there is framing. A frame is a theory that suggests that how something is presented to an audience can influence how people process that information.
Think about the “carbon tax”. This was either a failure or triumph of framing depending on how you look at it. The ETS was actually not a tax, in fact, as this article  explains, it’s kind of the opposite.
But still, it was framed as a tax. People don’t like taxes. Opposition built. Election were lost. The tax that was not a tax was scrapped.
We can learn from this.
In 2003 Republican consultant Frank Luntz laid out the climate strategy used by conservatives for the last 15 years. This was leaked in a memo and included advice such as using the term “climate change” instead of “global warming” because it sounded more natural and less alarming. This has led to the often repeated “climate is always changing” argument.
To counter this framing you have to not engage with it but to push a different, more compelling, frame – Lakoff suggests “climate crisis” but global warming also works.
This is about all of our futures – our lives, our quality of life, and that of our children. Keep it in that frame and you’re a lot closer to changing minds.
Non-violent communication (NVC) is a methodology created by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg as a way to bridge communication divides by focusing on universal human needs.
While it sounds quite touchy-feely, it is used by everyone from companies to personal therapists, and even hostage negotiators. NVC is all about listening, repeating, asking questions, and thinking about what needs are being expressed.
You begin with neutral observation and repetition. These conversations can degenerate to yelling matches without people even realising what the other is trying to say.
If someone tells you “climate change is natural” and that they’re sick of alarmists, NVC advises repeating back “I’m hearing you say that what’s happening is normal and people are exaggerating the dangers, is that right”.
In conversations that can quickly devolve into sloganistic shouting the process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge.
The second step is to talk about emotions rather than policy positions or facts, which should sound familiar by now.
If someone tells you they are sick of the “climate change cult” and “lying scientists”, ask them what they are feeling rather than arguing about something they are already upset about.
Do they feel confused, angry, overwhelmed, incredulous? Talking about the feeling behind the statement and your own feelings can help you start to see things from each others perspective, as long as you are doing it respectfully.
That’s a lot of talking about feelings but I assure you, this is effective – you can probably see now why I brought up hostage negotiations at the start.
Step three is to identify what need is being expressed – you can find a list here. I’ve written before about the empowering belief of climate denialism – and what a relief it would be if it were true.
The truth is that people don’t simply believe things. They hold beliefs because they empower them or give them utility. Try to understand what that utility or empowerment is.
The final step is a request. Ask the person if they would be willing to look at one of the graphs above, or read a first person piece from a firefighter, a farmer, or a soldier.
The main thing is to keep trying.
Stress the urgency, try to understand where people come from, have the conversations. This affects us all.

A spokesperson for the Department of Environment has confirmed the move in “mid-September” to Guardian Australia, and said it was being done “in order to improve its operating efficiency”.
Guardian Australia understands none of the authority’s staff, besides the chief executive, will stay with it after the move, which has been known about in relevant circles for some time.
The move has raised concerns it will bring the authority, which was set up in 2011 in Melbourne as an independent statutory agency, closer to government and limit its independence.
The Department of Environment spokesperson said the authority would continue to have “its own staff”. But whether those staff would be on secondment from the department is not yet known.
Several people close to the authority warned that since the expert staff of the authority did much of the agency’s work – including writing the reports that are directed and signed off by the board members – how close they were to government could affect the degree of independence it maintained.
Bernie Fraser, former chair of the Climate Change Authority and former chair of the Reserve Bank of Australia, told Guardian Australia that “the independence is one of the great features of bodies like the Climate Change Authority”.
Fraser said the personnel – both the staff and the board – need to work to uphold the independence of the authority. He said when he was head of the authority, the staff were “tremendously impressive”.
“Unfortunately that started to erode, after the change of government, and the talk of abolishing the authority – those good people thought the government isn’t going to listen and is going to get rid of the authority at the first opportunity,” Fraser said.
He said there was “something to” the concerns about independence if it was moved to Canberra, and particularly if the staffing turned out to be seconded from the department rather than hired independently.
Ian Chubb, a former member of the authority and the former chief scientist of Australia, said if the board was expert enough, then the independence of the staff shouldn’t impact the independence of the authority itself.
“I don’t think moving the secretariat to Canberra is moving the authority closer to government, other than literally,” he told Guardian Australia. “There are lots of organisations in Canberra at arm’s length from government. The independent board ought to have enough knowledge collectively not to let the wool get pulled over their eyes.” 
The Coalition attempted to abolish the Climate Change Authority in its last term in government but failed to get the legislation through the Senate, and continues to maintain its policy that it should be abolished.
In the Coalition’s 2016-17 budget, the Climate Change Authority was provided with an operating budget from existing Department of Environment funds until the end of 2016 only.
The move follows a dispute between members of the authority over a report on whether Australia should have an emissions trading scheme, leading to two members releasing a “minority report” and receiving a sharp rebuke from the authority’s chair, Wendy Craik.
Craik released a statement saying their report was “misleading”. She said while it “purports to be a minority report to the authority’s third and final report of its special review”, it “was not released or endorsed by the authority, and has no status as an authority report”.
Asked about whether the two dissenting members would continue on the board of the authority, a spokeswoman for the Climate Change Authority told Guardian Australia: “Whether the two members who wrote the dissenting report continue as members of the authority is a matter for them.”
Both dissenting members, the economist Clive Hamilton and the climate scientist David Karoly, said they would not resign over the matter, and they didn’t believe there were any grounds for them to be dismissed.
Fraser said he had read both the majority report and the minority report. “I thought the points in the minority point were very well made and deserve serious consideration, he told Guardian Australia.
Asked about the dispute and the future of the organisation, the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the disagreement was a matter for the authority but the government had no plans to commission any further reports from it.
The authority is still required to complete two more reports: a review of the carbon farming initiative legislation and a review of the national greenhouse and energy reporting legislation.",742,3.1847133757961787e-4,3.1847133757961787e-4,3.1847133757961787e-4,0.0035031847133757963,0.8283439490445861,3.1847133757961787e-4,0.01624203821656051,0.0035031847133757963,0.04808917197452229,0.09904458598726115,2016-09-06

At a meeting in Brussels in October 2013, Karel de Gucht told the firm that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could address its concerns about regulations in developing countries that restrict the company’s activities.
The news emerged as a Greenpeace barricade delayed the resumption of talks between EU and US delegations on the TTIP deal, which both sides hope can be completed before President Obama leaves office next January.
According to minutes of the October meeting, the hour-long conversation focused on shale gas; “geopolitical aspects”; EU plans to label tar sands as high-polluting; and a possible reconversion of ExxonMobil’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in the US to export crude to Europe. This would be “costly and may take two-three years,” the minutes said.
Heavily redacted records show that two officials from Exxon’s US and EU regions were present in the room with de Gucht, the then-trade commissioner, Claes Bengtsson, his cabinet member, and two other unidentified individuals. 
According to a briefing paper for de Gucht, released to the Guardian under access to documents laws, the commission was keen to point out the advantages that a TTIP deal could offer ExxonMobil, with respect to countries not party to the trade deal.
“TTIP is perhaps more relevant as setting a precedent vis-a-vis third countries than governing trade and investment bilaterally,” the paper says. “We think that this third country element is in the interest of the energy sector, and especially globally active companies like Shell or Exxonmobil. After all, companies like Shell or Exxonmobil face the same trade barriers when doing business in Africa, in Russia or in South America.”
The commission was in effect saying that once the trade deal was in place, other countries outside it would be progressively forced to adopt the same measures, making it easier for companies such as ExxonMobil to expand into their markets.
John Hilary, the executive director of the campaign group War on Want, accused the commission of overstepping its mandate in the talks. “It is tantamount to corruption that the European commission should be prepared to work hand in glove with such vested interests in crafting deals that will have a profound effect on our environment,” he told the Guardian.
At the time that the brief was written, several countries in the “global south” were tightening regulations on fossil fuel companies for the first time in a decade, despite ExxonMobil’s ambitions to open up shale gas fracking wells in North Africa, Asia and South America.
The briefing paper said that the TTIP talks were a unique chance to write a new rule-book for global trade that “could serve as a model for subsequent negotiations involving third countries”.
“The commission’s clear priority is establishing a template for all future deals,” Hilary said. “It is critical because it means that no countries will be able to tighten the regulatory regime on fossil fuel companies operating on their territories.”
Dr Valérie Marcel, associate energy fellow at Chatham House, said that in late 2013, fossil fuel firms had been increasingly fearful that the long-term investment climate was changing.
“There was a growing trend of producing countries wanting to capture maximum windfalls from petroleum projects,” she said. “They were imposing windfall taxes or threatening to change contractual terms, so they [the oil companies] probably wanted to put political pressure on those governments.”
ExxonMobil’s public response was to protest against regulatory frameworks, financial incentives and “protectionist policies,” which it said were holding industry back. It also called on the US to end its ban on exports of crude oil and LNG.
This was a position the firm shared with the EU, and which informed debate at the meeting whose minutes the commission redacted because they “reveal possible strategies that the commission may adopt in the ongoing negotiations,” according to documents previously released to the Guardian.
But commission officials deny offering ExxonMobil any advantages and, while declining comment on the discussions, insist that trade reform is needed.
“EU and US companies face discrimination when they need access to resources,” a commission spokesman told the Guardian. “Once they have produced the energy goods, they do not get access to the grid, or access at less favourable conditions. Energy resource countries supply energy resources at below market prices to their domestic industry. The EU and US industry is put at a disadvantage.”
Steve Kretzmann, the director of the campaign group Oil Change International, described the commission’s behaviour as a “scandalous” attempt to liberalise the global crude market that went beyond shale gas and shale oil.
“I see it as standard setting because it would allow the EU to place greater diplomatic and political pressure on those [developing] countries to lower all their trade barriers,” he said. “If the US is not doing this protective policy anymore you shouldn’t either.”
ExxonMobil would not respond directly to questions about the meeting. But Nikolaas Baeckelmans, the company’s vice-president of EU affairs, said: “ExxonMobil supports an open, unbiased, and rules-based trade and investment system. We see that as essential to global free enterprise and to promoting alignment of business interests, productivity, and economic growth.”",874,2.1186440677966104e-4,0.13368644067796612,0.2798728813559322,2.1186440677966104e-4,0.01927966101694915,2.1186440677966104e-4,0.3519067796610169,0.0023305084745762713,0.20783898305084744,0.0044491525423728815,2016-02-23

Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running.
Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records.
Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world’s climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world’s governments in Paris in December.
Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, 50-75% more likely.
The Paris agreement commits the world’s nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the Met Office data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher.
A strong El Niño event is peaking at the moment, putting the “icing on the cake” of high global temperatures. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity.
“Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said he expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing.
“It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels.
Noaa’s global temperature records stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa.
Nasa’s new data for 2015 also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.
“Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”
 The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day.
There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record.
Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.”
Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all.
Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which El Niño is now releasing. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the each of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade on record before. 
“It’s the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn’t get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”",840,0.44468599033816425,0.029227053140096618,2.4154589371980678e-4,2.4154589371980678e-4,0.0026570048309178746,0.4157004830917874,0.10652173913043479,2.4154589371980678e-4,2.4154589371980678e-4,2.4154589371980678e-4,2016-01-20

Few people in the world had such personal experience as Tony de Brum of the realities of sea level rises and storm surges, of warmer seas, receding beaches and abandoned land. Fewer still have been able to turn that experience into international action to save the islands, and the rest of the planet with them.
De Brum, who has died aged 72, acted as ambassador on climate change for the Marshall Islands, a sparsely populated group of more than 1,000 tiny islands spread out over nearly 30 coral atolls. In 2015, he was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change, by which the world’s governments collectively agreed, for the first time, to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is the limit of safety, and with an aspiration to ensure warming does not exceed 1.5C.
The 1.5C provision was crucial for the low-lying Pacific island states: scientists estimate that, at 2C of warming, the atolls would be overswept by sea level rises and frequent storm surges. Only a lower limit would give them a lifeline, but the challenge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with such a goal is immense, and while small developing countries were keen, many big economies balked at it. In the tense final days of the negotiations, De Brum helped to lead a coalition of developing and developed countries to forge a compromise and carry the day, resulting in the historic accord. He was hailed as “a real hero, a giant of history, a custodian of our shared future” by the Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, and by the former UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, as “an inspiring leader, a pillar of determination”.
De Brum’s work on climate change, while it will form perhaps his most lasting global legacy, was only the third of the great causes he espoused in a five-decade career of public service, during which he served as foreign minister of the Marshall Islands for three separate terms, interspersed with periods as minister of finance, of health and the environment, and as assistant to the president.
De Brum was born on Tuvalu, a former British colony 700 miles north of Fiji, as the war in the Pacific was nearing its final deadly stages. The family later moved to Likiep, in the Marshall Islands, at that time a trust territory of the US, which had wrested control from Japan. His father, Joe, became manager of Majuro airport; his mother, Cecilia, was a teacher.
When hostilities ended, the US began 12 years of nuclear testing in the area, with close to 70 blasts by 1958. As a boy, De Brum witnessed one of the consequences from a fishing boat. He later recalled: “I was fishing with my grandfather. He was throwing the net and suddenly the silent bright flash, and then a force, the shockwave. Everything turned red: the ocean, the fish, the sky, and my grandfather’s net. And we were 200 miles away from ground zero.” This was the Bravo Shot, the largest of the US nuclear tests carried out on Bikini Atoll, more than a thousand times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The Marshall Islanders’ campaign for freedom from the US lasted through the 1970s, with independence coming in 1979. After studying at Chaminade University, then the University of Hawaii – he was one of the first Marshall Islanders to attend university, according to Heine – De Brum took part in the negotiations, and in the independent governments that followed.
His experience of nuclear testing led to a lifelong crusade for nuclear disarmament, culminating in filing lawsuits against all nine nuclear-armed countries in the international court of justice in 2014. “Nuclear weapons are a senseless threat to essential survival. There are basic human and ethical norms, not to mention longstanding treaties, which compel those who possess them to pursue and achieve their elimination,” he said. The legal bid failed.
Unassuming in manner, grey-haired and grey-suited, De Brum could have been indistinguishable from the hundreds of other functionaries milling through the halls of UN meetings. There was nothing grey about his personality, however: affable and friendly, he was always ready with a quip or a wink for journalists, and shared stories about his beloved islands, his childhood and his family. He was as happy to greet groups of schoolchildren, or students dressed as polar bears, as to mingle with world leaders.
De Brum’s work at the two-week-long Paris talks was a masterclass in diplomacy. The debate over whether the 1.5C target should be included had the potential to wreck the talks – it had wrecked the previous attempt, eight years earlier in Copenhagen. By agreeing a compromise, he showed a pragmatism often absent from the negotiations, and helped lead his fellow small island states and least developed countries in joining with the EU and various others in the “coalition of high ambition”.
Some dismissed the 1.5C aspirational target as unachievable, but De Brum’s faith was borne out by a new study, published soon after his death in Nature Geoscience, a prestigious peer-review journal. It concluded that keeping within 1.5C was possible, though it required effort.
De Brum is survived by his wife, Rosalie (nee Maddison), whom he married in 1969, three children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, and by his father.

The world’s appetite for meat is rising fast as incomes grow but the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, already 12% of the total, are also soaring and taming global warming will be impossible unless the trend is reversed. Rising demand is also leading to more of the world’s natural areas being converted to farmland, a key factor in the mass extinction of species currently unfolding.
Globally, twice as much land is used to raise cattle, pigs and other animals than is used to grow crops. Furthermore, a third of those crops harvested are fed back to livestock. The new research is the first systematic comparison of the environmental impact of various sources of food, and found that imitation meat and insects are vastly more efficient than raising livestock.
The work, published in the journal Global Food Security, found that if half of traditional animal products were replaced by imitation meat or insects the land required to produce the world’s food would be slashed by a third. However, the researcher found that another alternative – lab-grown meat – did not show such big advantages. 
Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and who led the new research, acknowledges that eating insects is a challenging idea in western nations. But more than 2,000 species of insects are eaten by people across 119 nations today, including crickets and mealworm larvae. 
“It is very widespread, especially in Asia, and not seen as unusual in those cultures,” said Alexander. “We are not trying to mandate or even suggest some policy that you eat insects every day [but] our work indicates the potential benefits that are there.” The researchers also note that foods can become acceptable that were once shunned, as the tomato was in Europe for two centuries and as lobster was in the US.
Imitation meat, such as tofu and textured vegetable protein, has in the past been limited in its appeal. But the area is now seeing significant innovation, with products such as the Impossible burger promising the same taste as real meat. 
Alexander said it is crucial to tackle the world’s growing appetite for meat. “The developing world is eating more meat as they can afford to do so. That really is a concerning trend if it continues,” he said. “If everybody eats meat like an American does currently, then it’s going to be very difficult to sustain. With current production practices, more than the entire area of the planet would be required.”
The ideal solution is a global convergence on modest meat consumption, he said: “The west needs to eat less meat – though not none, I am not in favour of global vegetarianism – while allowing other countries with relatively low meat consumption to increase theirs.”
High levels of meat consumption are also known to damage people’s health, by contributing to obesity, heart disease and cancer, and a recent study showed that climate taxes on meat and milk would save 500,000 lives a year as well as cutting carbon emissions. 
“Even doing everything we can to reduce the emissions associated with meat production, rising demand means livestock emissions would take us beyond the global objective of 2C,” said Rob Bailey, research director for energy, environment and resources at Chatham House. “Therefore dietary change is a precondition for avoiding catastrophic climate change.”
Bailey said assessing the land requirements of different strategies was important: “Competition for land will increase in the future, so we have to find ways to feed a growing population without expanding agriculture further into forests.”
He said simply eating less meat, rather than substitutes, cuts environmental impacts the most. “We shouldn’t forget that the average British person eats two to three times more meat than is good for them, so this makes sense from both an environmental and a health perspective.” But he acknowledged this may not be easy and said the production of lab-grown meat was likely to become more efficient in future.
Government and campaign groups have had little appetite for tackling the overconsumption of meat, but Alexander said awareness of the issue is growing rapidly, though action is slow. “We are moving slowly in the right direction,” he said. “There is some cause for optimism but equally some cause for pessimism. It depends what side of the bed I get out of.”",737,2.9850746268656717e-4,0.2659701492537313,2.9850746268656717e-4,0.522686567164179,2.9850746268656717e-4,0.11074626865671643,0.02716417910447761,0.012238805970149253,2.9850746268656717e-4,0.060000000000000005,2017-05-05

Average temperatures around the world so far this year were nearly 1C (1.8F) above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather has affected all continents, while the melting of sea ice and glaciers and rises in sea levels continue. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and the 20 warmest have occurred in the past 22 years.
The warming trend is unmistakeable and shows we are running out of time to tackle climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization, which on Thursday published its provisional statement on the State of the Climate in 2018. The WMO warned that, on current trends, warming could reach 3C to 5C by the end of this century.
“These are more than just numbers,” said Elena Manaenkova, the WMO deputy secretary general. “Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life.”
The world has committed to keeping warming to no more than 2C above such levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said will cause the dieback of coral reefs, sea-level rises and extreme weather in many regions.
Greenhouse gas levels were also recently found to be at record levels, and a UN report this week said the world must triple its emissions reduction efforts to stay within 2C – and to stay within 1.5C, those efforts needed to be five times greater.
The IPCC found that continued rises in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 12 years could result in a breaching of the 1.5C limit.
On Monday, the Met Office said summer temperatures in the UK could be 5C hotter by 2070, making this year’s heatwave the norm for the future, while winters could get much wetter. London could become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding owing to sea-level rises, with the water level in the capital likely to rise by 1.15 metres by the end of the century.
The WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest.
The oceans have been absorbing record or near-record amounts of heat at certain periods. The year started with a weak La Niña event but by October there were signs of a return to El Niño conditions, which can raise global temperatures further.
There were a greater number of violent storms than usual, including 70 tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, compared with the long-term average of 53. Storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Korean peninsula and Tonga, while hurricanes Florence and Michael caused substantial damage in the US.
Wildfires raged in Greece, Canada, California and other areas, while floods devastated Kerala in India and displaced more than 1.4 million people. Japan also experienced serious flooding, as did east Africa.
Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, a leading authority on climate change, said: “We are not on track to meet climate targets and rein in temperature increases. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher.
“We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.”
Manaenkova added that every effort to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts of climate change was worthwhile. “Every bit matters,” she said, citing the harm done by temperature rises to every aspect of life, including economic productivity, food security, glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities.
Jens Mattias Clausen, Greenpeace’s head of delegation at the UN climate change conference (COP24) in Poland, said: “The evidence, if we needed any more, continues to stack up. The record-high heatwaves, record-low Arctic sea ice, above average tropical cyclones and deadly wildfires are an alarm bell impossible to ignore. We’re in the midst of a climate crisis and this meteorological report spells out the worsening threat in startling clarity. It’s no longer our future that is in peril; our today is at risk.
“The recent IPCC report also showed that we still have hope. We have 12 years to move the needle and any leader who comes to COP24 unprepared to step up and take action needs to read the WMO report and understand it’s time to stop talking and start acting on climate – while we still have the chance.”",768,0.6087301587301587,0.02142857142857143,2.6455026455026457e-4,0.04788359788359789,2.6455026455026457e-4,0.016137566137566138,0.3018518518518518,2.6455026455026457e-4,2.6455026455026457e-4,0.0029100529100529104,2018-11-29

Academics have suggested that people who tend to accept conspiracy theories also underplay or reject the science showing humans are causing rapid and dangerous climate change.
But a new study that tested this idea across 24 different countries found the link between so-called “conspiratorial ideation” and “climate scepticism” only really holds in the US.
University of Queensland psychology professor Matthew Hornsey and colleagues surveyed 5,300 people to test the link between climate “scepticism” and acceptance of four internationally propagated conspiracy theories around the assassination of President Kennedy, the 11 September terrorist attacks, the death of Princess Diana and the existence of a new world order.

Only in the US did the correlation fall outside the margin of error. This is perhaps not surprising, given the booming online conspiracy culture in the Trumpocene, with even would-be presidential science advisers hanging around with conspiracy theorists.
The study also tried to tease out the links between the rejection of human-caused climate change and the ideologies that people hold. 
It’s here that the study offers the greatest cause for hope, Hornsey says. He has developed a form of “jiujitsu” persuasion technique that he thinks might work.
There’s been a general acceptance that people who have broadly conservative or rightwing ideologies tend to rail against climate science because it rubs their worldview up the wrong way. That is, that tackling climate change will require broad interventions from governments.
But Hornsey’s study finds that “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”.
Instead, it suggests vested interests have managed to reshape the conservative identity with “ignorance-building strategies” in two countries – the US and Australia.
Hornsey agreed to expand on the study by answering further questions by email. 
You found that in the US people’s climate “scepticism” was more aligned to a conservative worldview than any other country surveyed. Why do you think the US is in this position?
I think it’s a result of two things. First, a lot of the big business interests that are threatened by climate change are situated in the US. My overall argument is that there’s nothing inherent to political conservatism that makes people want to reject climate science.
Rather, the link between conservatism and climate scepticism only emerges in countries that are economically threatened by the notion of responding to climate change. When the vested interests are high (in terms of the fossil fuel industry, for example) then there is more of a motivation for big business to engage in an organised campaign of misinformation around climate change. These campaigns often develop as a collaboration between the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians, and are designed to “coach” conservatives to believe that the climate science is not yet settled. From this perspective, conservatives don’t spontaneously feel the need to reject climate science; they only do so when they are taking their cues from conservative elites, and these cues only emerge when the economic stakes are high.
Second, America has an unusually intense brand of conservatism, one that has a particularly strong opposition to government interference in the free market. Climate science is a nightmare for these people, because in some ways it does imply a big-government response designed to regulate industry. 
What role do the views of high-profile politicians have in influencing voters to think about the issue in a certain way?
In the US people advertise their climate scepticism like they’re advertising their political gang colours
I think it plays a massive role. In many countries, climate scepticism is not part of the language of the conservative parties. But in Australia and America it is. So in those countries being a climate sceptic starts becoming part of the package of attitudes that you’re supposed to have if you’re a good conservative. The obvious example of this is in the US. Of the 17 candidates who campaigned to be the Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential campaign, the majority were climate change sceptics. So people’s sense of what it means to be a Republican in America has expanded to incorporate something that shouldn’t really be political, like climate science. There, people advertise their climate scepticism like they’re advertising their political gang colours. It’s not quite as bad here, but threatened to become like that during the [Tony] Abbott era.
Why do you think this has happened?
I think it’s all about vested interests. When the vested interests are high, the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians collaborate in an organised campaign of misinformation. In my data, the link between conservatism and scepticism is really only obvious in countries with high per capita carbon emissions. If you think of per capita carbon emissions as a measure of how fossil fuel reliant a country is, then this makes sense. In countries with low fossil fuel reliance – where the vested interests are low – then there’s no need to kick off a campaign of misinformation, and no motivation to believe one either.
In the paper, you say “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Can you clarify this? Doesn’t endorsement of small governments and low regulation actually predispose conservatives to engage in motivated reasoning to reject the science of climate change?
Yes, but most conservatives aren’t paying that much attention. I really think conservatives have to be trained and coached to pay attention, and to see the issue through the lens of their worldviews. In the 1980s you didn’t see conservatives get upset about governments shutting down CFCs to protect the ozone layer. Technically the issue was the same – government regulations curbing the freedom of industry – but because the vested interests were low there was no need for conservative elites to fight back.
What do you think it would take for the US and Australia to break the apparent link between conservative ideology and climate “scepticism”?
As the negative consequences of climate change become more severe and more immediate, I think the ideological element will fade away (although by then it’s likely to be too late, sadly). The other option is to use what I call “jiujitsu” persuasion techniques; to talk about climate mitigation in a way that aligns with people’s underlying ideologies rather than competing with them. There’s already evidence that if you frame climate change mitigation as something that’s sympathetic to free markets, or as a patriotic act designed to maintain energy security, or as a chance to generate green jobs, then conservatives are less likely to resist the science.

Aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are linked to lung damage, doubled since 1990 and are forecast to rise 43% by 2035.
The increase so far tracks a rise in the number of flights over the last 25 years, and a similar jump in the sector’s carbon dioxide emissions.
Airlines have reduced their planes’ NOx emissions in the last decade as the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) has tightened standards. But the improvements are coming too slowly, the report says.
 “We expect that the increase in growth in the air transport sector is going to offset those technological and operational efficiencies, leading to an absolute increase in emissions,” an official with the European Aviation Safety Agency told the Guardian.
NOx is an indirect greenhouse gas created by fuel combustion, that can lead to the formation of health-damaging air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM).
Around 23,500 Britons die prematurely each year from exposure to NOx, according to provisional government figures. Another 29,000 people die early from the effects of PM pollution.
High NOx concentrations around airports are a particular public health concern with Heathrow airport breaching safety limits in several different locations and times in 2012, according to its own measurements.
The UK government has been in beach of EU air quality laws since 2010, but a cleanup plan published in December did not envisage cities such as London becoming compliant for another decade.
Campaigners say that increasing emissions standards during aircraft landings and take offs would have the double benefit of protecting people who live close to airports and cutting the cruise emissions of airplanes in the future, as better engines are developed.
“The doubling of NOx emissions from aviation since 1990 is having a huge impact on our health and climate,” said Andrew Murphy, the aviation and shipping officer for Transport and Environment. “EU and international policies need to be urgently strengthened to reverse this trend, and that must include tighter emissions standards.”
The EU’s transport commissioner, Violeta Bulc, said that the report was intended to feed into international discussions on reducing planes’ emissions.
“Aviation brings significant economic and social benefits to Europe, but also has an impact on the environment,” she said. “In 2016, the EU will reach out to its partners to take global and ambitious steps.”
That process will begin in earnest in Montreal next week when a committee of the UN International Civil Aviation Organization meets to discuss a new CO2 standard for planes, and market measures to drive emissions down.",432,0.04889867841409692,0.2911894273127753,0.39691629955947133,4.405286343612335e-4,4.405286343612335e-4,0.004845814977973569,0.22070484581497798,0.03568281938325991,4.405286343612335e-4,4.405286343612335e-4,2016-01-29

In fact, 2017 was the hottest year without an El Niño by a wide margin – a whopping 0.17°C hotter than 2014, which previously held that record. Remarkably, 2017 was also hotter than 2015, which at the time was by far the hottest year on record thanks in part to a strong El Niño event that year.
For comparison, the neutral El Niño conditions and the level of solar activity in 1972 were quite similar to those in 2017. 45 years later, the latter was 0.9°C hotter than the former. For each type of year – La Niña, El Niño, and neutral – the global surface warming trend between 1964 and 2017 is 0.17–0.18°C per decade, which is consistent with climate model predictions.
I’ve been writing for the Guardian for almost 5 years now, and every year I’ve had to write a similar headline or two:
Those early years were the height of the denier frenzy about the mythical global warming ‘hiatus.’ At the time, John Abraham and I frequently wrote pieces pointing out that while various factors were temporarily dampening global surface warming, the oceans (which absorb over 90% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect) continued warming rapidly. 
It was only a matter of time until short-term effects stopped holding back the rise of Earth’s surface temperatures. That’s now happened, and as a result we’re seeing unleashed global warming causing record temperatures year after year. In fact, in February 2014 I wrote about a study that predicted this would happen:
the [ocean] heat uptake is by no means permanent: when the trade wind strength returns to normal - as it inevitably will - our research suggests heat will quickly accumulate in the atmosphere. So global temperatures look set to rise rapidly out of the hiatus, returning to the levels projected within as little as a decade.
Temperatures have in fact risen so quickly, it appears to have taken just a few years for that prediction to come true and for the denier focus on the short-term surface warming slowdown to look quite foolish.
Speaking of climate denial, on the 362nd day of the hottest year on record without an El Niño, the US president tweeted this:
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
Climate scientist Sarah Myhre aptly described the tweet as “Phenomenally dumb,” for several obvious reasons. 
Trump also began the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, leaving America as the only country in the world denying the urgent need to address global warming. Fortunately, every other nation is taking action to mitigate this existential threat, but there’s a shocking gap between reality and the ‘fake news’ beliefs of arguably the most powerful man in the world.
America was also battered by climate-fueled extreme weather events in 2017. Research has already shown that global warming boosted Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall (and associated flooding) by about 38%. California’s record wildfire season was similarly fueled by the state’s hot summer. The southwestern states were cooked by record hot summer temperatures this year, and global warming is making droughts in America and Europe worse. America was hit by 15 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2017, and it will likely be the costliest such year on record once all of the hurricane damages are tallied.
These extreme weather events are expensive. Until we manage to cut global carbon pollution, temperatures will continue to rise and climate change consequences will become more severe. While it broke many of today’s records, 2017 is just a taste of what’s to come.",649,0.5644230769230769,3.205128205128205e-4,3.205128205128205e-4,3.205128205128205e-4,3.205128205128205e-4,0.32724358974358975,0.01955128205128205,3.205128205128205e-4,0.08685897435897437,3.205128205128205e-4,2018-01-02

Here, six motivated people reveal why they’ve decided to fight for a better world","In a political climate where most adults are inert with despair, a growing number of teenagers are responding with action. After 14 children and three adults were massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, it was students – not parents, teachers or political representatives – who organised themselves to campaign for changes to US gun laws. The March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, DC on 24 March was accompanied by sister marches around the world: millions of young people supporting each other and demanding policy reform. Lead campaigner Emma González, a high-school student who now has more than 1.5m Twitter followers, made a call to arms for her peers to: “Fight for your lives before it’s someone else’s job.”
González is one of many teenagers shattering the stereotypes of the lazy, entitled, self-obsessed millennial. More and more teenagers are noisily questioning the world they’re inheriting and demanding things work differently. Here, we meet some of the young activists whose voices are increasingly impossible to dismiss.
Last spring, I was watching the news when there was a report on girls in the UK missing school because they couldn’t afford menstrual products. Some were using toilet paper, newspaper or socks. Thinking about girls my age going through this hit me hard. The report gained attention, but I felt the government was sweeping it under the carpet and we needed to pressure them to do something. So I did what felt normal to me and went online and started a petition. It calls for free menstrual products for children on free school meals. I didn’t imagine even getting 100 signatures. But in between revising for AS exams, I emailed as many people, companies and universities as I could. I asked my parents to send it around their work. My dad was a bit reluctant at first, but he did.
There’s huge embarrassment about periods, but it’s something half the world’s population will go through for a week every month. That it’s a taboo holds us back in achieving gender equality. Within two weeks, the petition reached 2,000 signatures. Comments were divided between people being shocked that this happens and others saying it affects them or their friends. Hearing that made me want to fight harder.
When the general election was announced, I emailed the parties. The Green party and Women’s Equality party both replied and included a pledge in their manifesto. I was so frustrated I couldn’t vote. Then in December we organised a protest outside Theresa May’s bedroom; more than 1,000 people came and shouted. To date, 150,000 people have signed the petition. It’s sad when adults are surprised to hear a young person being politically vocal. Young people are angry about the state of the world and a lot of us use social media to articulate that. I get asked to speak a lot.
The other morning, a TV station sent a car to school, I left for an hour, spoke on the issue and came back to a history lesson. My parents are supportive and as surprised as me that this has taken off. My dad went with me to the Women’s March, which was cool. But sometimes my mum can get annoyed if I’m doing lots of campaign stuff with exams coming up.
If someone tells me I should be in school right now, I know that they don’t see the bigger picture. Earth’s ability to support human life is falling apart and if things don’t change in the next five to 10 years, nothing’s going to matter.
I’ll finish high school, but right now this is the most important thing I can do with my time. Myself and 20 other kids are currently suing the Trump administration for violating our constitutional rights for failure to act on climate change. We originally launched it against the Obama administration a few years ago. The US government has known the fossil fuel industry is having a negative impact on our climate, yet they have been offering them subsidies and opening up land to exploration. We have just heard that we are going to trial in October.
I’m also involved in law actions and civil disobedience to stop fracking around my hometown of Boulder. In 2012, my friends and I successfully helped push for a five-year ban.
From a young age, I was aware of my part in protecting our planet. I was three or four the first time I went on a protest, and six when I started speaking at them. I was born in Colorado and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. My entire childhood was travelling, hanging out in nature and learning about my family’s indigenous heritage. My dad taught me that we have a responsibility to protect the Earth the way that our ancestors did.
I’ve spoken at the UN about my work. I was surprised how disrespectful, disconnected and sterile it was. The delegates were on their phones, not listening. They perked up when they heard I was just 15 years old. The power of me speaking wasn’t for them but for the millions of people my speech has since reached online.
The world is seeing how powerful young people are and how things are going to change. Adults on CNN and in the United States specifically, they can argue and cover gossip about Trump and his hair and porn stars. But young people are mobilising on the streets.
There’s so much power in what’s happening within our generation. We don’t have the respect we deserve, but I think it’s coming.
I’ve been racially abused since about 12, but it was never seen as an important thing to tackle. At secondary school, white children called me disgusting things, but teachers would turn a blind eye. And not just to racism, but sexism, homophobia, transphobia. There’s also internal racism in the Eritrean community. My dad is called names because he has darker skin. It all comes from preconceived ideas that black is less, or the darker you are the lower you are in terms of income, society and politics.
Because these problems weren’t taken seriously, I normalised them. But when I moved to a sixth form where the majority of students are black girls, I was surrounded by political and social consciousness. The more educated I got, the angrier I became. Last summer, I joined an organisation called the Advocacy Academy and, with a small group of people my age, we launched a campaign challenging the image and under-representation of black people in the media. We recreated iconic posters, such as Doctor Who, Titanic and Harry Potter, and made all the characters black. The campaign is rooted in personal experiences and I’ve gone from talking about things with my friends in the lunch hall to speaking about them nationally.
The Academy has revolutionised the way I think. Back in the day I definitely upheld toxic masculine identities. I’d tell myself that I didn’t cry. Challenging gender norms wasn’t of interest to me because I wanted to fit in with my friends. But I’ve learned to let go of my ego and be vulnerable so I can say what’s on my mind. It’s allowed me to take all the cold anger I have built up over years and turn it into something good. I’ve learned to become an ally to many other issues that don’t affect me directly.
After university, I don’t just want to get a really good job, buy a big house and forget about my community. I want to change something and challenge the status quo.
Even before the war in Syria, I wanted to change society, but I knew I needed to get educated to do that. Back then, we had a normal life. We went to school every day and saw our friends. The war started when I was 11 or 12. Going to school became difficult. There were people fighting on the ground, there would be bombing, sometimes bullets. Sometimes school was just closed because of budgets. My father is a teacher and he lost his job.
We left Syria five years ago, when I was 14. I was so worried about my future and education. We went to a refugee camp in Jordan. I didn’t expect there to be a school, but I was happy to discover a caravan with a tent and some teachers. There was no electricity. We studied computing from a book. In the winter, it got so cold it was hard to focus on the teacher.
But school gave me hope. And I started to encourage other girls and boys to go, too. I would walk from tent to tent, caravan to caravan, persuading kids and parents. I met people who thought that because we are refugees, education isn’t important any more, or that they’d continue school when they returned to Syria. I encouraged people to believe in themselves and not give up. I met kids who’d never been to school, and girls who saw marriage as their profession. Some parents told me it had nothing to do with me. I fought hard for everyone to believe that we can’t do anything without knowledge and got involved with international charities who supported me.
What’s happening in my country is not of our making and it’s not our fault that we’re losing our rights. One day, we’ll be able to return, and we need to have knowledge. After three years in Jordan, my family came to the UK. Last year I became the youngest and first refugee Unicef Goodwill Ambassador. I’m now on my way to university and am doubling my activism.
I came out at 14. When you’re a young LGBTQ+ person and you come out, you’re put in this position where you are suddenly expected to educate your peers. I’d be in a lesson and someone would ask me an incredibly inappropriate question. People feel like they have permission to access all of you when you’re still figuring things out for yourself.
At the same time, someone in my class was sending me online anonymous, violent messages, telling me to kill myself. My school didn’t know what to do with it. At one point, they had contacted my parents, pushing me to come out to them, too, and it all became detrimental to my mental health.
I don’t come from a political family, but I’ve always had a strong sense of fairness. After coming out, I started making educational YouTube videos on LGBTQ+ issues and people watched them. I also worked with my school to establish support systems and visibility for LGBTQ+ pupils. I got together with teachers to set up a group. We held events and assemblies, and suddenly others wanted to join. I worked with the school to run surveys of the staff and students, so we knew the issues that needed addressing.
As part of a Stonewall youth programme, I started a YouTube series called Queeries. I invite anyone to submit questions, however inappropriate or silly, and I sit down with another LGBTQ+ person and we answer them. Part of that is creating space for difficult questions, but also to give others a platform. I am very aware of the fact that I am white, middle-class and able-bodied, and there are a lot of things I feel I can’t speak to. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism, but campaigning is always something I’ve felt able to do.
I was happy to do the work with my school, and I know that education resources are stretched, but schools shouldn’t rely on pupils to affect change. That puts pressure on young people to challenge things adults should be addressing.
Many young people think they aren’t going to amount to anything because of all the headlines we read. But that’s designed to discredit our concerns about how the world’s being run. A lot of people in control are invested in the world as it currently stands; to suggest that things aren’t great the way they are scares them.
We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because we are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v Des Moines, we are going to change the law. And it’s going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the students now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.
If President Trump wants to tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.
It doesn’t matter because I already know: $30m. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the first one and a half months of 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 each. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don’t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down. And we will be worthless to you.
To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you. The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and call BS. Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are is self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn’t reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS.
Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about, that we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.

The delegates heard a series of strong political messages on Wednesday, urging them to use the final two days of the summit to complete important work on putting the landmark 2015 Paris deal into action. Without this, the world faces a devastating 3C or more of global warming.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the conference in Bonn of his visit to the Caribbean after this year’s hurricanes. 
“The catastrophic damage of climate change is upon us and when the frontline is devastated, the whole army is lost” he said, railing against the $825bn invested in fossil fuels in 2016. “We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future.”
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has been among the most vocal critics of Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris deal, got the loudest applause when he committed France and European partners to filling the funding gap for the UN’s climate science panel, left by the US withdrawal. “They will not miss a single euro,” he said.
Macron also emphasised the global importance of tackling global warming, saying: “The fight against climate change is by far the most significant struggle of our times.” He also addressed the issue that underpins most disputes at the global negotiations: the responsibility of rich nations that caused climate change to pay for the solution and compensate for the damage: “Climate change adds further injustice to an already unfair world.”
President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, representing African nations, said the need for faster action was urgent: “The fire is right under our feet. That is why I am expressing the extreme concern of Africa in light of the increase of disasters related to climate change. Africa suffers the loss and damage on a daily basis.” 
“It is now time for the developed countries to live up to their responsibilities,” said Baron Waqa, president of Nauru and representing small island states. “Lack of resources is the problem.”
The talks in Bonn have progressed reasonably smoothly, without the drama and walkouts of previous summits. But one issue has flared up – whether rich nations are doing enough before 2020 to cut their emissions and to help poorer nations cope with the impacts of global warming. 
It has been forced to the top of the agenda by the devastating floods and hurricanes seen around the world this year – as well as the meeting being run by the vulnerable island nation of Fiji. Negotiators agreed a deal on this on Wednesday, involving new stock takes of action in 2018 and 2019 and on progress towards the $100bn a year in climate funding that rich nations have promised to deliver by 2020.
The divisive issue of “loss and damage” – compensation for poor nations for the climate change damage – has been defused for now, with an expert meeting to address concerns next year. Progress has been made in drawing up the draft rules for implementing the Paris agreement, an essential step ahead of agreeing them in 2018.
Merkel, Guterres and Macron were almost upstaged by the first speech of the high-level session, given by 12-year-old Timoci Naulusala from Fiji, without any hint of nerves. Referring to the impact of Cyclone Winston in 2016, he said: “My home, my school, sources of food, money, water, were totally destroyed. My once beautiful village, which I called home, is a barren waste. Climate change is real, not a dream.” 
Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and president of the summit, said: “We are not simply negotiating words on a page, but we are representing all our people and the places they call home.”
Merkel, who as an environment minister chaired the first climate summit 23 years ago, has been under pressure this week to phase out Germany’s large coal-fired power stations, which are likely to bust Germany’s climate targets. 
“We still use a lot of coal, particularly lignite,” she said, acknowledging the issue is controversial, but she said jobs had to be taken into account too. She added that progress was expected in the next few days as she settles the terms of a new governing coalition with the Green and Liberal parties.
However, Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised both Merkel and the pope, said the 20,000 German jobs in coal would be lost to mechanisation in any case, and were a small number compared to the 600,000 created in the wider economy each year.
Macron set out unusual detail for a head of state in his speech, saying France would close all its coal power plants by 2021 and would ban all new exploration for fossil fuel in its territories. He also said France would fund interconnectors and energy storage technology to spread renewable energy around Europe and work to push the cost of CO2 emissions to €30 a tonne, which would end the viability coal and drive out gas.",851,0.005357142857142857,0.09719387755102041,2.5510204081632655e-4,0.002806122448979592,0.005357142857142857,0.002806122448979592,0.7706632653061225,0.018112244897959182,0.005357142857142857,0.09209183673469389,2017-11-15

Achieving the same reduction using only renewable energy would cost just half as much – between $24bn and $34bn – the report found.
The resources minister, Matthew Canavan, and the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, have been arguing for new coal power plants to be built in Australia.
Last week, Canavan released analysis he commissioned from the industry department, which found replacing all Australia’s coal power stations with the latest “ultra super-critical” coal-fired power stations would reduce emissions in that sector by 27%.
Frydenberg has also raised the conclusions in interviews, and promoted the benefits of coal power.
Neither has responded to questions about the cost of reducing coal-fired power emissions by 27% using the latest technology.
So Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne crunched the numbers, and found that the 27% reduction in the coal sector could be achieved, but it would cost $62bn.
McConnell said at a conservative estimate, achieving the reduction would require 20GW of new capacity. According to the latest estimates from the CSIRO, new ultra super-critical black coal costs $3,100 per kW to build.
“No wonder no one wants to talk about the costs,” McConnell said.
He said $62bn would be enough to build between 35GW and 39GW of wind and solar energy. Because that would produce less electricity than 20GW of coal power, it would not completely replace coal power, but it would reduce its emissions by up to 65%.
And that would amount to an emissions reduction of between 50% and 60% in the electricity sector as a whole.
McConnell found that if the 27% reduction in emissions from the coal generation sector were to be achieved with renewables, rather than with new coal, about 13-19GW of renewable energy would be needed, which would cost between $24bn and $34bn.
He said the scenario proposed by Canavan and Frydenberg would end up with 20GW of highly polluting coal power stations that were unlikely to be retired for decades.
On the other hand, McConnell said, if that money were spent on renewables, it would leave some coal and gas in place, which ultimately would still need to be removed to meet long-term emissions reduction targets.
Neither Canavan nor Frydenberg responded to questions about the costs of building new coal power stations. In a statement, Frydenberg said only that the government was committed to a “technology neutral” approach to meeting emissions targets.
“Arbitrarily excluding certain technologies for ideological reasons will lead to higher cost outcomes,” the statement said.
The Opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said: “This analysis clearly shows the government is off on an economically and environmentally irresponsible frolic with their trumpeting of ‘clean coal’.
“As the Australian Industry Group and many others have made clear, replacing our existing coal power with more coal power just doesn’t stack up; either on environmental or economic grounds.
“This is just the latest effort of a weak government to appease its irrational extreme right wing and distract from the fact they’re simply incapable of delivering real policy solutions to our significant energy challenges,” Butler said.
McConnell pointed out that the latest coal-powered fire stations were not at all “clean”. They produced about 700 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of electricity – much more than the 400 grams from new combined cycle gas turbines, and much more than the average produced by OECD countries, 420 grams per kilowatt hour in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency.
OECD countries will need to reduce that figure to just 15 grams per kilowatt hour if the world is to keep global temperature increases below 2C, the agency has said.",621,3.2362459546925567e-4,0.673462783171521,3.2362459546925567e-4,3.2362459546925567e-4,0.3239482200647249,3.2362459546925567e-4,3.2362459546925567e-4,3.2362459546925567e-4,3.2362459546925567e-4,3.2362459546925567e-4,2017-01-27

The bill, which will need to be approved by the state senate and Governor Jerry Brown, will require a complete shift to clean energy such as solar and wind by 2045. It would also demand that electric utilities source 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current target of 50%.
California ridding itself entirely of carbon-intensive energy has been a politically vexed proposition for the past two years, with state Republicans arguing it was unfeasible and would drive up electricity prices.
But the state has emerged as a bastion of defiance to the Trump administration on climate change, among other issues, as it has been scorched by record wildfires and a prolonged drought. A report released this week warned that the state is on course for punishing heatwaves, thousands of additional deaths and the erosion of two thirds of its coastline due to rising temperatures, wildfires and sea level rise. 
Brown has already set out ambitious goals to expand renewables and the use of electric cars. The state legislature has already passed a law that requires newly built homes to be equipped for solar power. In July, the state announced its greenhouse gas emissions were lower than in 1990, despite a growing economy.
The bill to go 100% renewable energy was authored by state senator Kevin de Leon, who called it a “victory for clean air. It’s a victory to tackle climate change and the devastation that it’s leaving in its wake.”
Brown has yet to confirm he will sign the bill his predecessor as governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wrote to lawmakers to back the legislation and urge them to be “undeterred by those who wish to stop our progress and move backwards”.
California becomes the second US state, after Hawaii, to call for carbon-free electricity by 2045. The clout of the Californian economy could help spur some other states, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, to do the same.
Environmentalists hailed the vote as a landmark moment.
“This is a pivotal moment for California, for the country, and the world,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. 
“California is showing the world that moving to 100% clean energy is within our reach and what bold climate leadership looks like in the face of a Trump administration.”
California currently sources around a third of its electricity from clean sources. Opponents of the 100% renewable bill warned that electricity prices would go up if the state relied too heavily upon intermittent solar and wind before energy storage improves.",441,0.1453271028037383,0.4397196261682243,0.0051401869158878505,4.6728971962616824e-4,4.6728971962616824e-4,4.6728971962616824e-4,0.014485981308411215,0.009813084112149532,0.3836448598130841,4.6728971962616824e-4,2018-08-29

The fund was a key aspect of the Paris agreement signed in 2015, which aims to keep global warming “well below” 2C and aspires to keep warming to 1.5C.
Established in 2010, it is financed by wealthy countries and used to assist developing countries with adaptation and mitigation. It was widely seen as a key measure to bring both rich and poor countries to the negotiating table.
The US committed to transferring $3bn to the fund. The new instalment leaves $2bn owing, with the incoming president, Donald Trump, expected to cease any further payments.
The move followed a large campaign, with more than 100 organisations and nearly 100,000 people calling for Obama to transfer the full $2.5bn owed to the fund.
“The Obama administration is refusing to let president-elect Trump’s posse of oil barons and climate deniers dictate how the world responds to the climate crisis,” said Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, of Corporate Accountability International, which led the campaign.
“Tens of thousands of people around the world called on President Obama to step up before Trump takes the keys of our government and tries to reverse decades of climate progress,” she said. “This victory is the climate justice movement’s opening salvo to the Trump presidency. And we’re not going away.”

Like Grenfell Tower, Hurricane Katrina revealed a disdain for the poor","There have been times in my reporting from disaster zones when I have had the unsettling feeling that I was seeing not just a crisis in the here and now, but getting a glimpse of the future – a preview of where the road we are all on is headed, unless we somehow grab the wheel and swerve. When I listen to Donald Trump speak, with his obvious relish in creating an atmosphere of chaos and destabilisation, I often think: I’ve seen this before, in those strange moments when portals seemed to open up into our collective future.
One of those moments arrived in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, as I watched hordes of private military contractors descend on the flooded city to find ways to profit from the disaster, even as thousands of the city’s residents, abandoned by their government, were treated like dangerous criminals just for trying to survive.
I started to notice the same tactics in disaster zones around the world. I used the term “shock doctrine” to describe the brutal tactic of using the public’s disorientation following a collective shock – wars, coups, terrorist attacks, market crashes or natural disasters – to push through radical pro-corporate measures, often called “shock therapy”. Though Trump breaks the mould in some ways, his shock tactics do follow a script, and one that is familiar from other countries that have had rapid changes imposed under the cover of crisis.
This strategy has been a silent partner to the imposition of neoliberalism for more than 40 years. Shock tactics follow a clear pattern: wait for a crisis (or even, in some instances, as in Chile or Russia, help foment one), declare a moment of what is sometimes called “extraordinary politics”, suspend some or all democratic norms – and then ram the corporate wishlist through as quickly as possible. The research showed that virtually any tumultuous situation, if framed with sufficient hysteria by political leaders, could serve this softening-up function. It could be an event as radical as a military coup, but the economic shock of a market or budget crisis would also do the trick. Amid hyperinflation or a banking collapse, for instance, the country’s governing elites were frequently able to sell a panicked population on the necessity for attacks on social protections, or enormous bailouts to prop up the financial private sector – because the alternative, they claimed, was outright economic apocalypse.
The Republicans under Donald Trump are already seizing the atmosphere of constant crisis that surrounds this presidency to push through as many unpopular, pro-corporate policies. And we know they would move much further and faster given an even bigger external shock. We know this because senior members of Trump’s team have been at the heart of some of the most egregious examples of the shock doctrine in recent memory.
Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has built his career in large part around taking advantage of the profitability of war and instability. ExxonMobil profited more than any oil major from the increase in the price of oil that was the result of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It also directly exploited the Iraq war to defy US state department advice and make an exploration deal in Iraqi Kurdistan, a move that, because it sidelined Iraq’s central government, could well have sparked a full-blown civil war, and certainly did contribute to internal conflict.
As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson profited from disaster in other ways as well. As an executive at the fossil fuel giant, he spent his career working for a company that, despite its own scientists’ research into the reality of human-caused climate change, decided to fund and spread misinformation and junk climate science. All the while, according to an LA Times investigation, ExxonMobil (both before and after Exxon and Mobil merged) worked diligently to figure out how to further profit from and protect itself against the very crisis on which it was casting doubt. It did so by exploring drilling in the Arctic (which was melting, thanks to climate change), redesigning a natural gas pipeline in the North Sea to accommodate rising sea levels and supercharged storms, and doing the same for a new rig off the coast of Nova Scotia.
At a public event in 2012, Tillerson acknowledged that climate change was happening – but what he said next was revealing: “as a species”, humans have always adapted. “So we will adapt to this. Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around – we’ll adapt to that.”
He’s quite right: humans do adapt when their land ceases to produce food. The way humans adapt is by moving. They leave their homes and look for places to live where they can feed themselves and their families. But, as Tillerson well knows, we do not live at a time when countries gladly open their borders to hungry and desperate people. In fact, he now works for a president who has painted refugees from Syria – a country where drought was an accelerant of the tensions that led to civil war – as Trojan horses for terrorism. A president who introduced a travel ban that has gone a long way towards barring Syrian migrants from entering the United States.
A president who has said about Syrian children seeking asylum, “I can look in their faces and say: ‘You can’t come.’” A president who has not budged from that position even after he ordered missile strikes on Syria, supposedly moved by the horrifying impacts of a chemical weapon attack on Syrian children and “beautiful babies”. (But not moved enough to welcome them and their parents.) A president who has announced plans to turn the tracking, surveillance, incarceration and deportation of immigrants into a defining feature of his administration.
Waiting in the wings, biding their time, are plenty of other members of the Trump team who have deep skills in profiting from all of that.
Between election day and the end of Trump’s first month in office, the stocks of the two largest private prison companies in the US, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the Geo Group, doubled, soaring by 140% and 98%, respectively. And why not? Just as Exxon learned to profit from climate change, these companies are part of the sprawling industry of private prisons, private security and private surveillance that sees wars and migration – both very often linked to climate stresses – as exciting and expanding market opportunities. In the US, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) incarcerates up to 34,000 immigrants thought to be in the country illegally on any given day, and 73% of them are held in private prisons. Little wonder, then, that these companies’ stocks soared on Trump’s election. And soon they had even more reasons to celebrate: one of the first things Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, did was rescind the Obama administration’s decision to move away from for-profit jails for the general prison population.
Trump appointed as deputy defence secretary Patrick Shanahan, a top executive at Boeing who, at one point, was responsible for selling costly hardware to the US military, including Apache and Chinook helicopters. He also oversaw Boeing’s ballistic missile defence programme – a part of the operation that stands to profit enormously if international tensions continue to escalate under Trump.
And this is part of a much larger trend. As Lee Fang reported in the Intercept in March 2017, “President Donald Trump has weaponised the revolving door by appointing defence contractors and lobbyists to key government positions as he seeks to rapidly expand the military budget and homeland security programmes … At least 15 officials with financial ties to defence contractors have been either nominated or appointed so far.”
The revolving door is nothing new, of course. Retired military brass reliably take up jobs and contracts with weapons companies. What’s new is the number of generals with lucrative ties to military contractors whom Trump has appointed to cabinet posts with the power to allocate funds – including those stemming from his plan to increase spending on the military, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security by more than $80bn in just one year.
The other thing that has changed is the size of the Homeland Security and surveillance industry. This sector grew exponentially after the September 11 attacks, when the Bush administration announced it was embarking on a never-ending “war on terror”, and that everything that could be outsourced would be. New firms with tinted windows sprouted up like malevolent mushrooms around suburban Virginia, outside Washington DC, and existing ones, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, expanded into brand new territories. Writing in Slate in 2005, Daniel Gross captured the mood of what many called the security bubble: “Homeland security may have just reached the stage that internet investing hit in 1997. Back then, all you needed to do was put an ‘e’ in front of your company name and your IPO would rocket. Now you can do the same with ‘fortress’.”
That means many of Trump’s appointees come from firms that specialise in functions that, not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable to outsource. His National Security Council chief of staff, for instance, is retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg. Among the many jobs Kellogg has had with security contractors since going private was one with Cubic Defense.
According to the company, he led “our ground combat training business and focus[ed] on expanding the company’s worldwide customer base”. If you think “combat training” is something armies used to do all on their own, you’d be right.
One noticeable thing about Trump’s contractor appointees is how many of them come from firms that did not even exist before 9/11: L-1 Identity Solutions (specialising in biometrics), the Chertoff Group (founded by George W Bush’s homeland security director Michael Chertoff), Palantir Technologies (a surveillance/big data firm cofounded by PayPal billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel), and many more. Security firms draw heavily on the military and intelligence wings of government for their staffing.
Under Trump, lobbyists and staffers from these firms are now migrating back to government, where they will very likely push for even more opportunities to monetise the hunt for people Trump likes to call “bad hombres”.
This creates a disastrous cocktail. Take a group of people who directly profit from ongoing war and then put those same people at the heart of government. Who’s going to make the case for peace? Indeed, the idea that a war could ever definitively end seems a quaint relic of what during the Bush years was dismissed as “pre–September 11 thinking”.
And then there’s vice-president Mike Pence, seen by many as the grownup in Trump’s messy room. Yet it is Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who actually has the most disturbing track record when it comes to bloody-minded exploitation of human suffering.
When Mike Pence was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate, I thought to myself: I know that name, I’ve seen it somewhere. And then I remembered. He was at the heart of one of the most shocking stories I’ve ever covered: the disaster capitalism free-for-all that followed Katrina and the drowning of New Orleans. Mike Pence’s doings as a profiteer from human suffering are so appalling that they are worth exploring in a little more depth, since they tell us a great deal about what we can expect from this administration during times of heightened crisis.
Before we delve into Pence’s role, what’s important to remember about Hurricane Katrina is that, though it is usually described as a “natural disaster”, there was nothing natural about the way it affected the city of New Orleans. When Katrina hit the coast of Mississippi in August 2005, it had been downgraded from a category 5 to a still-devastating category 3 hurricane. But by the time it made its way to New Orleans, it had lost most of its strength and been downgraded again, to a “tropical storm”.
That’s relevant, because a tropical storm should never have broken through New Orleans’s flood defence. Katrina did break through, however, because the levees that protect the city did not hold. Why? We now know that despite repeated warnings about the risk, the army corps of engineers had allowed the levees to fall into a state of disrepair. That failure was the result of two main factors.
One was a specific disregard for the lives of poor black people, whose homes in the Lower Ninth Ward were left most vulnerable by the failure to fix the levees. This was part of a wider neglect of public infrastructure, which is the direct result of decades of neoliberal policy. Because when you systematically wage war on the very idea of the public sphere and the public good, of course the publicly owned bones of society – roads, bridges, levees, water systems – are going to slip into a state of such disrepair that it takes little to push them beyond the breaking point. When you massively cut taxes so that you don’t have money to spend on much of anything besides the police and the military, this is what happens.
It wasn’t just the physical infrastructure that failed the city, and particularly its poorest residents, who are, as in so many US cities, overwhelmingly African American. The human systems of disaster response also failed – the second great fracturing. The arm of the federal government that is tasked with responding to moments of national crisis such as this is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), with state and municipal governments also playing key roles in evacuation planning and response. All levels of government failed.
It took Fema five days to get water and food to people in New Orleans who had sought emergency shelter in the Superdome. The most harrowing images from that time were of people stranded on rooftops – of homes and hospitals – holding up signs that said “HELP”, watching the helicopters pass them by. People helped each other as best they could. They rescued each other in canoes and rowboats. They fed each other. They displayed that beautiful human capacity for solidarity that moments of crisis so often intensify. But at the official level, it was the complete opposite. I’ll always remember the words of Curtis Muhammad, a longtime New Orleans civil rights organiser, who said this experience “convinced us that we had no caretakers”.
The way this abandonment played out was deeply unequal, and the divisions cleaved along lines of race and class. Many people were able to leave the city on their own – they got into their cars, drove to a dry hotel, called their insurance brokers. Some people stayed because they believed the storm defences would hold. But a great many others stayed because they had no choice – they didn’t have a car, or were too infirm to drive, or simply didn’t know what to do. Those are the people who needed a functioning system of evacuation and relief – and they were out of luck.
Abandoned in the city without food or water, those in need did what anyone would do in those circumstances: they took provisions from local stores. Fox News and other media outlets seized on this to paint New Orleans’s black residents as dangerous “looters” who would soon be coming to invade the dry, white parts of the city and surrounding suburbs and towns. Buildings were spray-painted with messages: “Looters will be shot.”
Checkpoints were set up to trap people in the flooded parts of town. On Danziger Bridge, police officers shot black residents on sight (five of the officers involved ultimately pleaded guilty, and the city came to a $13.3m settlement with the families in that case and two other similar post-Katrina cases). Meanwhile, gangs of armed white vigilantes prowled the streets looking, as one resident later put it in an exposé by investigative journalist AC Thompson, for “the opportunity to hunt black people”.
I was in New Orleans during the flooding and I saw for myself how amped up the police and military were – not to mention private security guards from companies such as Blackwater who were showing up fresh from Iraq. It felt very much like a war zone, with poor and black people in the crosshairs – people whose only crime was trying to survive. By the time the National Guard arrived to organise a full evacuation of the city, it was done with a level of aggression and ruthlessness that was hard to fathom. Soldiers pointed machine guns at residents as they boarded buses, providing no information about where they were being taken. Children were often separated from their parents.
What I saw during the flooding shocked me. But what I saw in the aftermath of Katrina shocked me even more. With the city reeling, and with its residents dispersed across the country and unable to protect their own interests, a plan emerged to ram through a pro-corporate wishlist with maximum velocity. The famed free-market economist Milton Friedman, then 93 years old, wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal stating, “Most New Orleans schools are in ruins, as are the homes of the children who have attended them. The children are now scattered all over the country. This is a tragedy. It is also an opportunity to radically reform the educational system.”
In a similar vein, Richard Baker, at that time a Republican congressman from Louisiana, declared, “We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn’t do it, but God did.” I was in an evacuation shelter near Baton Rouge when Baker made that statement. The people I spoke with were just floored by it. Imagine being forced to leave your home, having to sleep in a camping bed in some cavernous convention centre, and then finding out that the people who are supposed to represent you are claiming this was some sort of divine intervention – God apparently really likes condo developments.
Baker got his “cleanup” of public housing. In the months after the storm, with New Orleans’s residents – and all their inconvenient opinions, rich culture and deep attachments – out of the way, thousands of public housing units, many of which had sustained minimal storm damage because they were on high ground, were demolished. They were replaced with condos and town houses priced far out of reach for most who had lived there.
And this is where Mike Pence enters the story. At the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological Republican Study Committee (RSC), a caucus of conservative lawmakers. On 13 September 2005 – just 15 days after the levees were breached, and with parts of New Orleans still under water – the RSC convened a fateful meeting at the offices of the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. Under Pence’s leadership, the group came up with a list of “Pro-Free-Market Ideas for Responding to Hurricane Katrina and High Gas Prices” – 32 pseudo-relief policies in all, each one straight out of the disaster capitalism playbook.
What stands out is the commitment to wage all-out war on labour standards and the public sphere – which is bitterly ironic, because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned Katrina into a human catastrophe in the first place. Also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry. The list includes recommendations to suspend the obligation for federal contractors to pay a living wage; make the entire affected area a free-enterprise zone; and “repeal or waive restrictive environmental regulations … that hamper rebuilding”. In other words, a war on the kind of red tape designed to keep communities safe from harm.
President Bush adopted many of the recommendations within the week, although, under pressure, he was eventually forced to reinstate the labour standards. Another recommendation called for giving parents vouchers to use at private and charter schools (for-profit schools subsidised with tax dollars), a move perfectly in line with the vision held by Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Within the year, the New Orleans school system became the most privatised in the US.
And there was more. Though climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures, that didn’t stop Pence and his committee from calling on Congress to repeal environmental regulations on the Gulf coast, give permission for new oil refineries in the US, and green-light “drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”.
It’s a kind of madness. After all, these very measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions, the major human contributor to climate change, which leads to fiercer storms. Yet they were immediately championed by Pence, and later adopted by Bush, under the guise of responding to a devastating hurricane.
It’s worth pausing to tease out the implications of all of this. Hurricane Katrina turned into a catastrophe in New Orleans because of a combination of extremely heavy weather – possibly linked to climate change – and weak and neglected public infrastructure. The so-called solutions proposed by the group Pence headed at the time were the very things that would inevitably exacerbate climate change and weaken public infrastructure even further. He and his fellow “free-market” travellers were determined, it seems, to do the very things that are guaranteed to lead to more Katrinas in the future.
And now Mike Pence is in a position to bring this vision to the entire United States.
The oil industry wasn’t the only one to profit from Hurricane Katrina. Immediately after the storm, the whole gang of contractors who had descended on Baghdad when war broke out – Bechtel, Fluor, Halliburton, Blackwater, CH2M Hill and Parsons, infamous for its sloppy Iraq work – now arrived in New Orleans. They had a singular vision: to prove that the kinds of privatised services they had been providing in Iraq and Afghanistan also had an ongoing domestic market – and to collect no-bid contracts totalling $3.4bn.
The controversies were legion. Relevant experience often appeared to have nothing to do with how contracts were allocated. Take, for example, the company that Fema paid $5.2m to perform the crucial role of building a base camp for emergency workers in St Bernard Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. The camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed. Under investigation, it emerged that the contractor, Lighthouse Disaster Relief, was in fact a religious group. “About the closest thing I have done to this is just organise a youth camp with my church,” confessed Lighthouse’s director, Pastor Gary Heldreth.
After all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut, there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work. Author Mike Davis tracked the way Fema paid Shaw $175 per sq ft to install blue tarps on damaged roofs, even though the tarps themselves were provided by the government. Once all the subcontractors took their share, the workers who actually hammered in the tarps were paid as little as $2 per sq ft.
“Every level of the contracting food chain, in other words, is grotesquely overfed except the bottom rung,” Davis wrote, “where the actual work is carried out.” These supposed “contractors” were really – like the Trump Organization – hollow brands, sucking out profit and then slapping their name on cheap or non-existent services.
In order to offset the tens of billions going to private companies in contracts and tax breaks, in November 2005 the Republican-controlled Congress announced that it needed to cut $40bn from the federal budget. Among the programmes that were slashed: student loans, Medicaid and food stamps.
So, the poorest people in the US subsidised the contractor bonanza twice: first, when Katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts, providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services; and second, when the few programmes that assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills.
New Orleans is the disaster capitalism blueprint – designed by the current vice-president and by the Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank to which Trump has outsourced much of his administration’s budgeting. Ultimately, the response to Katrina sparked an approval ratings freefall for George W Bush, a plunge that eventually lost the Republicans the presidency in 2008. Nine years later, with Republicans now in control of Congress and the White House, it’s not hard to imagine this test case for privatised disaster response being adopted on a national scale.
The presence of highly militarised police and armed private soldiers in New Orleans came as a surprise to many. Since then, the phenomenon has expanded exponentially, with local police forces across the country outfitted to the gills with military-grade gear, including tanks and drones, and private security companies frequently providing training and support. Given the array of private military and security contractors occupying key positions in the Trump administration, we can expect all of this to expand further with each new shock.
The Katrina experience also stands as a stark warning to those who are holding out hope for Trump’s promised $1tn in infrastructure spending. That spending will fix some roads and bridges, and it will create jobs. Crucially, Trump has indicated that he plans to do as much as possible not through the public sector but through public-private partnerships – which have a terrible track record for corruption, and may result in far lower wages than true public-works projects would. Given Trump’s business record, and Pence’s role in the administration, there is every reason to fear that his big-ticket infrastructure spending could become a Katrina-like kleptocracy, a government of thieves, with the Mar-a-Lago set helping themselves to vast sums of taxpayer money.
New Orleans provides a harrowing picture of what we can expect when the next shock hits. But sadly, it is far from complete: there is much more that this administration might try to push through under cover of crisis. To become shock-resistant, we need to prepare for that, too.

Speaking on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program, the chair of Doctors for the Environment New South Wales, Dr John Van Der Kallen, asked panellists why health was not a primary consideration in the discussion over the closure of coal-fired power stations such as the Liddell plant in the Hunter Valley “when we know that the pollution from these coal-fired power stations contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illness, as well as premature death?”
Doctors for the Environment also oppose the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which if built, will be the largest in Australia, and one of the largest in the world.
“It will significantly increase Australia’s contribution to international carbon emissions and threaten the health of millions of people in Australia and around the world.”
Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said health concerns over coal-fired power were driving movement to renewables in other parts of the world.
“You only have to look at China which is grappling with some really substantial and quite dangerous health impacts on the community in terms of not having heavily regulated the coal-fired power industry and not managing the health implications of coal-fired generation.”
Herd said governments and business needed to take into account the physical and environmental effects of different types of energy generation.
“Interestingly enough, it is this very driver of managing environmental pollution which is actually now the basis of so much of China’s actions in terms of being a world leader in investing in renewable energy, taking it to more than 50% of global investment in renewable energy in the last few years.”

The assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, said Australia’s energy’s policy needed to be a balance between reliability, affordability and environmental concerns.
“The government has a focus, we want to ensure reliability, we want to assure affordability, and, of course, we want to meet our emissions reduction targets – 26 to 28% under the Paris accord. We are focused on those three objectives.”
Sukkar said each objective needed to be carefully weighed against the others.
“Of course, the environmental objective … is one very important one. But we do have to manage this transition and … at the end of the day, when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining … everyone around the country still expects to be able to switch their lights on and know that it’s going to be there.
“That’s what we need. Now, coal for the foreseeable future, will play a role in that. Of course, it’s playing a diminishing role over time, but in our lifetime, it will stay a big role.”

Bleaching happens when algae that lives in the coral is expelled due to stress caused by extreme and sustained changes in temperatures, turning the coral white and putting it at risk of dying if conditions do not return to normal. 
Unusually warm ocean temperatures due to climate change and a strong “El Nino” phenomenon that pushes up temperatures further have led to coral reefs worldwide being affected in a global bleaching event over the past two years. 
Preliminary results of a survey in May this year found all the reefs looked at in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, were affected by high sea surface temperatures. Around 60% of all assessed coral colonies, and up to 90% in some areas, were bleached. 
The study was conducted by the Maldives Marine Research Centre and the Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 
It took place on Alifu Alifu Atholhu - North Ari Atoll - chosen as a representative atoll of the Maldives. 
Dr Ameer Abdulla, research team leader and senior adviser to the IUCN on marine biodiversity and conservation science, said: “Bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe due to global climate change. 
“Our survey was undertaken at the height of the 2016 event and preliminary findings of the extent of the bleaching are alarming, with initial coral mortality already observed. 
“We are expecting this mortality to increase if bleached corals are unable to recover.” 
The Maldives contains around 3% of the world’s coral reefs and the islands are considered particularly at risk of climate change because they are low-lying and threatened by sea level rises. 
In Australia, more than a fifth of the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to have died as a result of the worst mass bleaching event in history.

The Climate Council’s new report, “Towards Morocco: tracking global climate progress since Paris,” questions Australia’s ability to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target.
It says Australia is likely to face serious pressure next week when world leaders meet in Marrakesh, Morocco, for the first time since the landmark Paris agreement was signed.
Eighty-seven countries have ratified the Paris agreement, including 10 of the largest polluters. These countries cover more than 55% of global emissions. The Paris agreement will come into force on 4 November.
The world’s top three emitters of carbon dioxide – China (27%), the US (15%) and India (7%) – have ratified the agreement.
Australia has not yet ratified the agreement.
Prof Will Steffen, a climate change expert and researcher at the Australian National University, told Guardian Australia it was “virtually certain” that 2016 would be the hottest year on record.
“I think Australia will face quite a bit of pressure at the meeting, because when you look at the targets we made in Paris, they’re weak compared to other countries in the G20,” he said.
“And even with those weak targets, we’re not on track to meet them. So I think there’s going to be some very direct questioning of Australia about its effort, about what its plans are and what policy instruments it plans to use in coming years to significantly reduce emissions.”
The Climate Council report says Australia’s emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% by 2030 (on 2005 levels) relies on the introduction of energy productivity and vehicle efficiency measures, which the federal government has yet to bring into force.
“The most recent update of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions shows our emissions are rising,” the report says.
“Countries including China and the United States have put more than 30 questions to the federal government, asking for detail about how Australia will meet its 2030 emissions reduction target and raising concerns about a lack of transparency over how the government calculates and reports emissions.”
A year ago in Paris, at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), world leaders agreed to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.
The agreement was signed by 197 countries, including Australia.
But the Climate Council says if Australia is to fairly contribute to staying below the 2C target, a “more rapid downward trend in emissions from all sectors of the economy is required, with much stronger action to reduce our emissions.”
There has been widespread expert criticism of the government’s Direct Action climate policy. Experts argue the framework is not sufficient to deliver the emissions reductions Australia signed on to in Paris.
There has also been a change of political emphasis in the Turnbull government over renewable energy.
Greg Hunt, the then federal environment minister, at the Paris conference, gave state governments clear encouragement to develop their own renewable energy schemes. “I have encouraged the states that if they want to do something extra, [they should] apply reverse auctions to the renewable energy target (RET) in the way the Australian Capital Territory has done,” Hunt said last December in Paris.
But since the election, the Turnbull government has been sharply critical of state-based renewable energy targets that will help Australia meet its Paris commitments.
State governments argue the commonwealth will not be able to meet the emissions reduction targets agreed in Paris without the state-based RET schemes.
Correspondence from a senior federal official to the energy regulators after an energy council meeting in August seen by Guardian Australia underscores that point, suggesting the state-based schemes will deliver just under 40% of renewables in the national electricity market by 2030.
The Coalition has agreed to review the Direct Action climate policy in 2017, but the government has played down expectations that review will lead to a significant strengthening of the current policy framework, despite the widespread criticism of the current regime.
The South Australian government has signalled it wants to build broad support across the states for a form of carbon trading to apply to the electricity sector.",684,2.898550724637681e-4,0.1510144927536232,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,0.4553623188405797,2.898550724637681e-4,0.3915942028985507,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,2016-11-02

Despite uncertainty about the fundamental nature of the PDO, leading scientists link its 2014 phase change to a rapid rise in global surface temperatures.
The effects of the PDO on global warming can be likened to a staircase, with warming leveling off for periods, typically of more than a decade, and then bursting upward.
“It seems to me quite likely that we have taken the next step up to a new level,” said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
The 2014 flip from the cool PDO phase to the warm phase, which vaguely resembles a long and drawn out El Niño event, contributed to record-breaking surface temperatures across the planet in 2014.
The record warmth set in 2014 was surpassed again in 2015, when global temperatures surged to 1°C (1.8°F) above pre-industrial averages, worsening flooding, heatwaves and storms.
Trenberth is among an informal squadron of scientists that in recent years has toiled to understand the slowdown in surface warming rates that began in the late 1990s, which some nicknamed a global warming “pause” or “hiatus.”
A flurry of recent research papers has indicated that the slowdown was less pronounced than previously thought, leading some scientists to renew claims that those nicknames are inaccurate and should be abandoned.
“The slowdown was not statistically significant, I suppose, if you properly take into account natural variability, which includes the PDO,” Trenberth said. “That’s sort of the argument that people have been making; that even if it was a little bit of a slowdown, or pause, or call it what you will, it’s not out of bounds, and as a result we shouldn’t really put a label on it.”
The approximately 15-year warming slowdown was linked to the negative phase of the PDO, which is also called its cool phase. That phase whips up strong trade winds that bury more heat beneath sea surfaces, contributing to extraordinary levels of warming recorded in the oceans. A similar phase led to a slight cooling of the planet from the 1940s to the 1970s.
“Last time we went from a negative to a positive was in the mid-‘70s,” said Gerald Meehl, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. “Then we had larger rates of global warming from the ‘70s to the late ‘90s, compared to the previous 30 years.”
“It’s not just an upward sloping line,” Meehl said. “Sometimes it’s steeper, sometimes it’s slower.”
The effects of the warm phase of the PDO and the current El Niño may be cumulative in terms of warming the planet. It also seems likely that changes in the ocean cycles are linked, with changes between El Niño and La Niña driving changes in the PDO cycle.
Or, perhaps the PDO doesn’t exist at all, other than as a tidy pile of data points, and it’s simply a manifestation of changes in the shorter-running cycle between El Niño and La Niña.
“There’s some debate about whether there is a low frequency oscillation — is there a distinct interdecadal oscillation?” said Penn State meteorology professor Michael Mann. “Or is what we call a low frequency oscillation just a change over time in the frequency and magnitude of individual El Niño and La Niña events?”
Regardless, “it seems pretty clear that we’ve transitioned from a time period where there was a prevalence for La Niña conditions,” Mann said. “Over the past several years we’ve been in the multi-year El Niño state, and it has culminated with an extremely large El Niño event.”
The future of PDO phases will not slow down or speed up the overall long-term rate of global warming. That will continue to rise with pollution levels. But scientists are expecting more intense heat during the months ahead, which should bring with it more wild weather.
“There are a lot of things in place that have locked us on course to have a really warm start to 2016,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Nate Mantua. “I have a hard time seeing how we’re not going to be looking at either record level or near-record level global mean surface temperatures for at least the first half of 2016.”",755,0.6019774011299435,2.824858757062147e-4,2.824858757062147e-4,2.824858757062147e-4,0.0031073446327683617,0.38446327683615816,0.0031073446327683617,2.824858757062147e-4,2.824858757062147e-4,0.005932203389830509,2016-01-06

The Extinction Rebellion group will support the demonstration outside the Department for Education, which organisers describe as a “peaceful nonviolent protest that may involve civil disobedience”.
It is intended as a show of solidarity for pupils who skipped classes last Friday to express their frustration at the failure of older generations to adequately address climate change. Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities in the UK joined the strike.
More would be likely to follow, they said, if the government did not live up to a Paris climate agreement promise to enhance climate change education. Instead, they say, there is currently no requirement for children to be taught about the climate crisis so it is treated, at best, as a peripheral subtopic of subjects like geography and science.
They are also unhappy that part of the curriculum appears to cast doubt on the evidence for man-made climate change, even though governments, the UN and the overwhelming majority of scientists accept that it is happening. Government guidelines for key stage 4 chemistry say pupils should be taught “evidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change”.
Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham, said students in the state system could easily go through 11 years of compulsory education and hear climate change mentioned in fewer than 10 lessons out of approximately 10,000. Given the scale of the crisis, he believes this is “negligent”.
“Climate and ecological breakdown will define the life of every child and student alive today. They and we are facing an unimaginable catastrophe. But when I tell my students, it’s hard for them to take me seriously when it plays almost no part in the content of their education,” he said.
Earlier this month, the group Teachers for Climate Truth wrote to the DfE to request an overhaul of the current curriculum to prepare children for a future that will be shaped by ecological and climate crisis
“When we have had the evidence for decades, why does it amount to little more than a footnote in our national curriculum – a vague and marginal concern?” asks the letter. “If we keep this information out of the public domain – out of schools, for example – perhaps we might avoid some awkward conversations in the years to come … after all, who wants to tell a child that, unless we make unprecedented changes to how we live, we are heading for societal collapse, famine, war and the increasing likelihood of human extinction?”
The picture is not black and white. There is considerable scope for schools and teachers to go beyond guidelines.
The government said the current curriculum already included many related issues including classes on seasonal changes, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, eco-systems, the composition of the atmosphere and the impact of carbon dioxide on the climate. “Children are very engaged, otherwise they would not be joining protests. That shows they are obviously being taught quite well,” said a government official.
The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment; all they will do is create extra work for teachers,” he said.
Friday’s demonstration is expected to draw between 100 and 200 teachers and academics, most of whom are on half-term holiday. Organisers are also in talks with unions to discuss how to increase support during the next global youth climate strike on 15 March, with possibilities ranging from a walkout by teachers to the setting of homework on climate topics. Extinction Rebellion will also offer workshops for students.
Elsewhere, the stakes are growing. In Australia – which has seen waves of school walkouts in recent months – the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, warned students and teachers that they will be punished if they skip classes to join a global climate rally on 15 March.
The initiator of the school strike movement, Greta Thunberg, responded with a defiant tweet. “OK. We hear you. And we don’t care. Your statement belongs in a museum.”
Last week, 200 academics expressed support for the youth activists in an open letter on the Guardian. Among the signatories was Alison Green, a doctor of psychology who resigned from her position as pro-vice chancellor of Arden University so that she could concentrate on climate activism. She will join the protest on Friday.
“It’s incredibly brave for schoolchildren to confront what must be a terrifying prospect; that the future they hope for isn’t available to them,” she said. “We’ve been humbled that children have gone on strike despite threats of detentions and other punishments. We should at least match their courage.”",796,0.0031518624641833815,2.865329512893983e-4,0.0031518624641833815,2.865329512893983e-4,2.865329512893983e-4,0.14068767908309457,0.07478510028653296,0.6650429799426933,2.865329512893983e-4,0.11203438395415473,2019-02-21

But all that is about to change","In the coming weeks, the Paris climate agreement could be about to enter into force. Action to meet the deal’s targets of holding global warming to 2C is most clearly visible in the energy sector - where a low-carbon transition is underway. There is, however, one sector where, until now, action has been invisible owing to its exemption from contributing to the fight to limit carbon pollution: international aviation.
Aviation is one of the top-10 global carbon polluters. The industry emits more CO2 each year than the 129 countries with the lowest annual emissions. Worryingly, those emissions are expected to balloon by 300% if no concerted action is taken sooner rather than later. In 2010, 2.4 billion passengers travelled by plane, but by 2050 that number is expected to rise to 16 billion. The global agreement reached in Paris last December committed the world’s governments to fighting climate change. Curbing aviation emissions is absolutely essential to fulfilling those commitments. However, aviation was conspicuous by its absence from the text.
Aviation has, in fact, historically found itself in a parallel universe when it comes to the industry’s contribution to the fight against climate change: it has made none. Airlines have been operating in a world where they pay no fuel taxes, are VAT-exempt, face no legally-binding fuel efficiency requirements, and have no limits placed on their CO2 emissions. But this could all be about to change and not before time.
The UN body responsible for international civil aviation, ICAO, has been charged with creating a global market-based mechanism to offset the industry’s growth in emissions from 2020 onwards. Transport ministers from all around the world are set to meet at the next ICAO Assembly in Montreal, from 27 September to 7 October 2016, and they must live up to their responsibilities. It is essential ministers agree a global market-based mechanism for international aviation that delivers carbon neutral growth from 2020 - with a significant ramping up of that ambition over time.
Such a commitment to carbon neutral growth post-2020 would, itself, not be enough to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement. And the current state of negotiations suggests that any final agreement will, in any case, fall far short of even that fundamental commitment.
Worryingly, in a blatant attempt to delay vital action, ministers are set to agree that binding limits should not come into force before 2027. Until then, two ‘voluntary phases’ of the scheme are expected, allowing continued and limitless growth in aviation emissions. Furthermore, the current proposals are plagued by a large number of unacceptable exemptions that are pegging back ambition. EU Transport Ministers attending the ICAO Assembly have a duty to make sure the global market-based mechanism is robust enough to deliver on the commitments made in Paris. 
This means, firstly, ensuring the ambitions of the scheme remain dynamic, and under constant review. It is essential that the scheme includes guarantees on the environmental integrity of offsets, and that it prohibits double-counting and provides transparency on the offsets used. Secondly, the scope of participation must be sufficiently wide-ranging, and the wealthiest countries must take responsibility for their historical burden and pledge to do more to reduce emissions. 
Finally, allowing regional blocs such as the EU to take further measures to curb aviation emissions is an essential part of enabling them to honour the commitments they made in Paris, especially if ICAO fails to deliver. Under EU law, international flights to and from the European Union will once again fall under the block’s emissions trading scheme from 2017. It is vital, therefore, that there are no attempts to water down this mechanism. While the ICAO compromise is too weak to deliver what is necessary to keep temperature increases below dangerous levels, it does have the potential to deliver significant action if certain clauses are strengthened and the widest possible political engagement is secured.
This is why we must all increase the pressure on our governments to make sure they reach an agreement in Montreal that is as ambitious as possible and finally shakes aviation from its parallel universe, forcing it to take a stake in efforts to tackle our common challenges. With a Paris deal coming into action, the world cannot afford a failure in its first global attempt to put words into action.",711,2.949852507374631e-4,0.3070796460176991,0.13303834808259588,2.949852507374631e-4,0.04454277286135693,2.949852507374631e-4,0.5135693215339233,2.949852507374631e-4,2.949852507374631e-4,2.949852507374631e-4,2016-09-26

The fast-melting ice in the Arctic and an increase in snowfalls in Siberia, both the result of global warming, are changing winter weather patterns over east China, scientists found. Periods of stagnant air are becoming more common, trapping pollution and leading to the build up of extreme levels of toxic air.
The work is the latest to show that changes in the rapidly warming Arctic are already leading to severe impacts for hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia. The US has also seen a rise in episodes of stagnant air, which may be leading to higher air pollution there.
“The very rapid change in polar warming is really having a large impact on China,” said Prof Yuhang Wang, at Georgia Tech in the US, who led the new research. “Emissions in China have been decreasing over the last four years, but the severe winter haze is not getting better.”
“Mostly that’s because of a very rapid change in the high polar regions where sea ice is decreasing and snowfall is increasing,” he said. “This perturbation keeps cold air from getting into the eastern parts of China, where it would flush out the air pollution.” 
The new research is convincing, according to Prof Jennifer Francis, at Rutgers University in the US, who said people should be concerned at the growing evidence that the thawing Arctic is having major consequences further south. “Not all the impacts of a melting Arctic are bad – such as taking the edge off of winter cold snaps – but most of the effects will have a negative impact on the billions of people living in temperate regions,” she said.
Air pollution causes 1.4 million early deaths every year in China and the “airpocalypse” in 2013, when levels soared to 10 times national limits, grabbed global attention. The US embassy had been tweeting data on the “crazy bad” air, which led the Chinese government to open up its reporting and then to crack down on pollution later in 2013.
However, despite cuts in emissions helping clear the air in summer, the winter haze remained a serious problem, leading Wang’s team to investigate. Their research, published in the journal Science Advances, found that periods of stagnant air over east China correlated closely with years of very low Arctic ice and high snowfall in Siberia.
They then used climate models to show that these changes in the Arctic could cause domes of high pressure in the region, under which low winds meant air pollution builds up instead of being blown away. 
The 2013 “airpocalypse” followed the record low Arctic ice in late 2012 and record high snow in northern Siberia. Arctic ice plunged to its second lowest extent in late 2016 and China was again hit with an extreme air pollution event this winter. “2013 was off the chart” in terms of poor ventilation conditions over east China, said Wang. “And the winter of 2016-17 was nearly as bad.”
The researchers concluded that “extreme haze events in winter will likely occur at a higher frequency in China” as climate change continues to heat up the Arctic. Wang said this should drive an increased urgency in cutting both air pollution and the carbon emissions that cause global warming.
“When you look at haze reduction, it is not just about reducing emissions of air pollutants, it is also about reducing emissions of greenhouses gases from China and all the other countries in the world, so we can possibly slow down the rapidly changing Arctic climate,” Wang said.
The emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity is responsible for at least half, and possibly up to two-thirds, of the fall in summer sea ice in the Arctic since the late 1970s, according to recent research.",647,0.6477564102564103,0.18301282051282053,0.016346153846153844,3.205128205128205e-4,0.003525641025641026,0.13493589743589743,3.205128205128205e-4,0.006730769230769231,0.006730769230769231,3.205128205128205e-4,2017-03-15

Marco Rubio, the Florida senator fighting strongly on home ground as he sought to revive his presidential campaign, was asked: “Will you acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change?”
Rubio said: “Sure, the climate is changing … There was never a time when the climate was not changing.”
But Rubio then said flooding in south Florida was caused by the fact that it was built on a swamp. He favored mitigation measures, he said.
“As far as a law that we can pass in Washington that can change the weather?” he asked. “There’s no such thing.” 
Rubio then moved on to a familiar theme, decrying the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency, emissions regulations and “the war on coal”.
“These laws that people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and hurt the economy,” Rubio said.
The debate continued, Ohio governor John Kasich saying that “I do believe we contribute to climate change” but adding: “You can have strong environmental policy at the same time as you have strong economic growth.”
The question and the candidates’ responses may not have much impact on the race going forward, including the Florida primary on Tuesday.
A poll from Quinnipiac University last month found that 7% of Democrats rate climate change as the most important issue in determining which candidate they support for the party’s presidential nominee.
But when Republicans were asked the same question, the results were so low (less than 1%) that Quinnipiac simply reported climate change issues with “–” in the results summary.
In response to the exchanges on the Republican stage, the leader in the Democratic nomination race, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, tweeted a reference to a familiar GOP campaign line: “Republican candidates deny climate change because they’re ‘not scientists’.”

But the two sources of renewable energy are far from getting equal love from corporate America.
Wind energy has long been the favorite. Businesses, not counting power companies, signed 2,000 megawatts of it in 2015, a jump from 100 megawatts in 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Wind energy is enabling Google, the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity in the world, to hit the 100% renewable energy goal, which it expects to achieve next year. The company has inked 2,548 megawatts of wind contracts and 141 megawatts of solar from projects around the world.
Interest in solar energy is growing, but at a slower rate. Solar contracts shot up to 1,070 megawatts in 2015 from 339 megawatts in 2010, said the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Wind energy has historically been much cheaper than solar, making it a more attractive option, especially when energy can be a major expense for a company. As more businesses come under pressure from their customers, investors or government regulators to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and help rein in global warming, they will be looking for low-carbon energy that can compete with the price of coal and natural gas.
Wind and solar are not the only sources of electricity with lower carbon footprints than coal and natural gas. Hydropower and nuclear are too, and, unlike solar and wind, are able to produce electricity any time. But hydropower plants require access to ample sources of surface water. A nuclear power plant can take longer to secure permits and cost more than building other types of power plants.
“Corporate participation (in buying solar and wind) is still relatively new,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, which recently announced the biggest wind energy contract, at 178 megawatts, in its renewable energy portfolio. “It’s only within the last few years that we’ve seen an uptick, and we’ve yet to fully address the challenges in expanding this market.”
America pioneered early research and development of commercial turbines, installing the world’s first wind farm in 1980 and leading the amount of installations, in megawatts, until the late 1990s, when Germany and eventually China began to catch up and then slowly push ahead. Solar hasn’t experienced the same long term and consistent investments and construction, which help to lower cost.
Wind power costs cratered 66% in the last six years, said the American Wind Energy Association. The lowest price for a wind contract is around $0.02 per kilowatt-hour while it’s $0.03 for solar, said Ryan Wiser, a renewable energy market researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. That minor difference in price can add up to a hefty bill for heavy users of electricity, such as data centers that require an around-the-clock electricity supply.
More than half of the 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy contracts last year, and 3,440 megawatts this year, were signed by companies across industries from tech to grocery chains, according to the wind trade association and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Utilities bought the rest.
Amazon, for example, has invested more in wind and solar in the past two years. It’s paying for power from a 150-megawatt wind farm in Indiana and waiting for a 208-megawatt wind project in North Carolina to come online soon. It’s also signed agreements for several hundred megawatts of new wind energy that are scheduled to start delivery in 2017.
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dow Chemical and 3M are buying five times more wind than solar, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Solar has become an increasingly attractive option following a massive construction of factories to build solar panels, mostly notably in China. Prices for solar contracts have dived 63% over the last five years, said the solar trade association.
In the 2016 ranking of top corporate solar energy buyers, Target gets the top spot with 147.5 megawatts of installed capacity, according to the solar trade association. The retailer is followed by industrial real estate developer Prologis (107.8 megawatts), Apple (93.9 megawatts), Costco (50.7 megawatts) and Kohl’s (50.2 megawatts).
Businesses looking to sign renewable energy contracts or even develop their own solar or wind projects often find themselves on a steep learning curve about borrowing money, structuring contracts and understanding the complex rules that govern the electric industry. Getting rid of these road blocks will encourage more companies to lower their use of fossil fuel energy, business leaders said.
For a company that operates in many states or even countries, figuring out a way to standardize renewable energy contracts helps it to save money and time, Janous said.
“How do we make deals more attainable for not just Microsoft but smaller companies? There has to be some simplification,” he added.
In cities where the local power companies don’t offer much, if any, wind or solar energy for sale, businesses could install their own solar panels or wind turbines on their properties. The cost of this do-it-yourself model has historically been higher than paying for electricity supplied by the local utilities, noted Herve Touati, managing director of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewable Center. But that cost is coming down and, in some cases, lower than the electricity from the grid.
“It’s cheaper for Microsoft to use onsite generation than ask utilities to double their existing grids,” Touati said.
Companies with renewable energy contracts or a stake in a solar or wind farm typically don’t use that low-carbon electricity directly – electricity from power plants of all types usually enters the transmission lines and gets mixed up. As a result, businesses would count the amount of solar or wind they pay for against their overall electricity use to calculate their carbon footprint reduction.
Despite uncertainties about the impact of a Trump administration on renewable energy – the president-elect has criticized regulations that pressure businesses to address climate change – businesses and market analysts said the prices for renewable energy have fallen steep enough to make them a more feasible option.

Our politicians fail to grasp the scale and urgency of the risk humanity faces. The UK signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, but has yet to develop a coherent and rigorous national plan for their domestic and international implementation.
Encouragingly, the SDGs form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation.
The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income.
We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy.Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of the West of EnglandStephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University
• Both Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes are reminders that we need to rebuild our societies now if we are to avoid them facing climate collapse in the near future. But both initiatives need to avoid the fate of the Occupy movement, which had huge support 10 years ago but disintegrated because of a lack of precise demands and concrete policy goals.
Fortunately, many such policies already exist. The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law.
These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition.
One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries.Jakob von UexkullFounder, World Future Council
• Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers: take climate change seriously, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values).
“In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous. Climate change is just such a risk of change.”
But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases.David MurrayWallington, Surrey
• Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (‘Calling bullshit’: the college class on how not to be duped by the news, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation.
In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net.Geoff NaylorWinchester, Hampshire
• In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system.John AirsLiverpool
• I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (Journal, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences.
I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

Climate change, bringing Arctic meltdown, has serious global effects which mean very much more than the extinction of polar bears. Climatologists have long been warning of new atmospheric conditions which make freak events the new normal. The latest by Jennifer Francis comes in the April edition of Scientific American, which predicts massive coastal flooding within the next 20 years.

That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.
Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic.
Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time.
While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access.
“Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.”
The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south.
Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.”
By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole.
Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields.
Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the Guardian. “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.”
This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today.
Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.”
He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions.
The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost.
However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said.
Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia.
Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the Guardian the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated.
“In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”.
“For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.”
Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road.
The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month.
“The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said.
The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating.
Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity.
“It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said.
Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea.
“The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses. That’s completely wrong.”",1369,0.3876304023845008,1.4903129657228018e-4,0.11341281669150521,0.015052160953800298,1.4903129657228018e-4,0.03442622950819672,0.22220566318926974,0.021013412816691505,0.1104321907600596,0.09552906110283159,2019-01-24

Unleashing US innovation on the trillion-dollar clean technology market will create good US jobs, stimulate its economy, maintain the US’s political leadership around the globe and, not least, make the world a safer place by tackling climate change, the experts told the Guardian.
The omens are not encouraging. Trump has called global warming a hoax and is filling his administration with climate change deniers and oil barons. But reversing action on climate change and championing fossil fuels will only “make China great again”, said one top advisor.
Here are the messages to Trump from some of the key figures the Guardian contacted. 
If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America great again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation.
“Mr President, if you want to make China great again, you have to stay the course you have promised. I think it would be the end of US domination in innovation, in economics. If you try to take the US backwards to the days of mountain top removal [for coal] in West Virginia and all those things, then you will just make sure China becomes No 1 in all respects. In the end, you would produce precisely what you promised to avoid to your electorate.”
If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950.
If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth.
If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow.
“If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.”
[Mr Trump] you might not realise it yet, but your action, or inaction, on climate will define your legacy as president. The renewable energy transformation is unstoppable and, if the US chooses to turn its back on the future, it will miss out on all the opportunities it brings in terms of jobs, investment and technology advances. China, India and others are racing ahead to be the global clean energy superpowers and surely the US, led by a businessman, does not want to be left behind.
Trump’s stance threatens to diminish America’s standing in the world and to weaken the ability of US companies and workers to compete in the rapidly growing global market for clean energy technologies.
Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history.
Some leading figures, who will have to deal directly with the Trump administration, chose more diplomatic messages to the new president, while emphasising the vital need to act on global warming:
I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world.

5cc16391a2c36151699895a4,article,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/out-of-the-wreckage-george-monbiot-review,William Davies,1,Books,"Politics books, Society books, Financial crisis, Climate change, Economics, Books, Culture, World news",8,1505370635000,0,94,Out of the Wreckage by George Monbiot review – the thrill and danger of a new left politics,"With neoliberalism in crisis, it’s time to emphasise the importance to people of belonging and co-operation, argues this optimistic call to action","That which is dangerous can also be thrilling. Many liberal democracies are engaged in something dangerous, as questions of identity, community and nationhood are being asked with a fresh urgency, with some of the answers turning out to be deeply disturbing. But is there also something thrilling going on? The capacity for democracy to throw up surprises, such as Britain’s 2017 general election result, is mesmerising. Brexit may be a famous act of economic self-harm, but something new will be born one way or the other. Still the danger persists and may be growing.
That this is happening now, as opposed to 10 or 20 years ago, is a direct consequence of the disintegration of the economic policy framework that has held sway in Britain, the US, the European commission and many multilateral institutions for much of the previous 40 years. That framework is often referred to as “neoliberalism”, even if the term irritates a certain class of pundit, for whom it is some sort of swearword without any clear referent. Its disintegration is producing conflicting sympathies, as many on the left come to realise the xenophobia that can be unleashed in the absence of stable market-based rules.
For George Monbiot, neoliberalism should best be understood as a “story”, one that was conveniently on offer at precisely the moment when the previous “story” – namely Keynesianism – fell to pieces in the mid-1970s. The power of stories is overwhelming, as they are “the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals”. The particular story of neoliberalism “defines us as competitors, guided above all other impulses by the urge to get ahead of our fellows”.
This story may not have been all that attractive, but it provided meaning and clarity. It offered a guide on what to do and how to live. With the rise of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, neoliberalism came to govern how policies were designed and institutions constructed. More diffusely, it came to shape how we understand ourselves, leading us to take on ever more responsibility for our own needs, economic security and wellbeing, devaluing social bonds and dependency in the process.
The grand global difficulties of neoliberalism are plain to see. The financial crisis was testimony to the stupidity of deregulation, while the inability to move on from it demonstrates that orthodox economic policy tools no longer work. Solutions to climate change are hamstrung by the need to respect existing corporate and financial strategies. But Monbiot also details considerable psychological and biological evidence for how the ethos of individual competition harms us all, running counter to our innate needs and instincts. Loneliness and distrust are not just the defining social problems of our age, but increasingly posing risks to our health.
The problem is that we have no new story to tell, and are therefore trapped in a groundhog day of repetition. The principal objective of Out of the Wreckage is to identify exit routes from this miserable condition. Few of the policy ideas contained within it are original to Monbiot (he credits their sources regularly and generously) and some (such as participatory budgeting and basic income) have been around for some time, but they are rarely assembled into a single overarching narrative. Monbiot is offering his services principally as a storyteller. He reserves particular enthusiasm for the environmental economics of Kate Raworth and the participatory campaigning techniques of the Bernie Sanders campaign.
To construct the new story, he leans heavily on the burgeoning evidence for our innately social and empathetic nature. Human beings are the “supreme cooperators”, which explains our dominance within the natural world. Altruism and concern for others’ feelings are evolutionary properties that are central to our biology, hence the fact that “social” pain (such as loneliness or grief) produces many of the same symptoms as “physical” pain. Most of this research was unknown when the neoliberal story was first being told by economists such as Friedrich von Hayek in the mid-20th century, but it highlights central aspects of the human condition that are neglected by our individualistic and competitive culture.
What this suggests, Monbiot argues, is that a new political story must privilege belonging above all. We need to feel we belong to a particular place and a particular community, with whom we can achieve common goals. We need to combat the epidemic of alienation with a new set of institutions, through which individuals can collectively shape their own lives and environments. Out of the Wreckage makes an impassioned and optimistic case for greater democracy in virtually all areas of life, from global to local, kicking big money out of politics in the process. At the same time, Monbiot’s intuition regarding “belonging” resonates with the present political mood. Was it not a desire for belonging that drove much of the Brexit vote, or at least a sense of not belonging to Brussels?
This is a highly contemporary book, potentially offering the left a set of implements with which to win arguments on terrain often dominated by the populist right. After the depressing sight of Boris Johnson touring ex-industrial regions in a bus promising NHS funding that he knew would never materialise, the need for a more sincere vision of how people might “take back control” remains pressing. Monbiot’s hopeful, practical energy is precisely what the left needs right now. Some of it borders on the utopian, but then so did Hayek’s story.
Optimism does produce its blind spots. Monbiot is alive to the thrill of popular power, but the dangers are absent. He touches on the pessimistic vision of Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century philosopher who argued that the central function of the state is to stop us slaughtering each other, given our innately suspicious and arrogant nature. “Today,” Monbiot reassures us, “knowing what we do about the nature and origins of humanity, we can state unequivocally” that Hobbes’s view “is mistaken”. We’d all like this to be true (even Hobbes would have done), but that’s a brave call, especially on the post-neoliberal precipice on which we stand.
The yearning for belonging has historically been associated with romantic conservatism, although Monbiot offers some good counterexamples, such as the Clarion magazine, which formed socialist societies and ramblers’ and cycling clubs during the 1890s. In the current climate, this poses a couple of questions, at least for the less optimistic reader. One is whether democratic participation can deliver the same sense of belonging as the darker political forces that are stirring, with their promise to look after their own and lock out the others. If the left is to start a conversation about belonging, it needs to be confident that it can finish it. After all, there is another storyteller in Britain, also challenging the cult of GDP growth and prioritising a sense of belonging: his name is Nigel Farage.
It is far from certain that democracy – even thriving, inclusive democracy – will produce the happy social and environmental outcomes Monbiot expects it to, including a respect for science. The indeterminacy of popular power is both its thrill and its danger. At one point Monbiot writes expertly on how to combine music, “energisers” and speakers to convert the vitality of protest marches into more lasting campaign outcomes. “The energiser would bring back the musicians to lead the crowd in an anthem: there’s no better way of generating a sense of solidarity and shared emotion,” which sounds as much like a Trump rally as the ones that attract Monbiot’s sympathies.
Monbiot might well respond that severe dangers have already been realised, in the form of climate change, political corruption, psychological distress and inequality. Why live in fear of emerging enemies, when the established ones are already running amok? Out of the Wreckage is partly an activists’ manual, which aims to coordinate and energise those who want a different world. You don’t build an evocative story out of warnings and fears. I hope it succeeds.

Now she aims for change beyond Twitter,"In February last year, a week after Donald Trump had signed an anti-abortion executive order surrounded by seven men, Isabella Lövin posted a photograph of herself on Twitter signing a climate change bill alongside seven other women.
Sweden’s then deputy prime minister remained enigmatic as the picture went viral and she was asked whether she had been “trolling” the US president. “It is up to the observer to interpret the photo,” she was quoted as saying. “We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo.”
The image made headlines around the world and, nearly two years on, is still what Lövin is best known for internationally. But the Swedish Green party leader and minister for international development is no mere social media politician. During her party’s historic first period in government she relentlessly pushed through an exhausting list of more than 50 policies, including a flight tax, the so-called Swedish Proposal, which tripled the price of EU emissions credits, and the carbon law she was signing in the picture that went viral.
Lövin is one of the leading figures in what she says is a resurgence in environmentally conscious politics across the continent. “There is a green wave going on in Europe, in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, and in Finland as well,” she says. “I’m convinced that green parties offer a positive vision, and also the willingness to take on the huge challenges that we see in the world right now.”
The slogan on her Twitter profile, “The climate can’t wait”, sums up the Lövin approach.
“We’ve been very focused on results, and many of these issues have beenfundamental, long-term policies,” she says, sitting in her office in Sweden’s foreign ministry.
“To work seriously on changing policies and setting long-term targets, and forming majorities and doing agreements with other parties, those things don’t pay off very easily in PR strategies.”
It’s the same single-mindedness she as shown ever since bursting into public life 10 years ago following the 2007 publication of Silent Seas – The Fish Race to the Bottom, a rigorously researched, dramatic exposé of the crisis in global fisheries.
“It totally changed my life,” she says of the book, published when she was 44. “But what really changed my life was the decision to write the book. I felt such a huge anxiety and anger about what we’re doing to our planet, and specifically when I understood the issue of overfishing – because we’re actually destroying our oceans with our eyes open.” I decided ... I will try to write about this topic, and then at least I’ve tried’.”
The book was a sensation, winning Sweden’s two main journalism prizes, and launching a process which saw Lövin sent to Brussels as an MEP by the Green party with a single mission: to push through reform of fisheries policies. When I ask if she succeeded, she laughs. “Quite modestly I have to say ‘yes’. I was there for five years and we managed to get a majority in the European parliament to ban shark finning, overfishing and discarding fish, and to bring in a new common fisheries policy that sets the target that we must have sustainable fish stocks by 2020.”
There’s a section in the book when she considers rescuing a dogfish, still alive at a fish auction, and releasing it into the sea. But she bristles when I ask if she sees herself as an eco-warrior. “No, no, no. Never. For me, it was extremely important to really do the research and see the facts,” she says.
“I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious. It’s not just being like an image, that you’re an eco-warrior or whatever. This is really happening now.”
That is why, when the Swedish Green party formed a coalition with the Social Democrats in 2014, Lövin took the next step and joined the national government, first as minister for international development cooperation, then, when her colleague Åsa Romson resigned, as deputy prime minister and climate minister. “It was tough for me personally,” she says. “But I felt if I don’t do this, I might regret for the rest of my life I didn’t try to do something about the problems I saw.”
Government has also been a bruising experience for the party, particularly at the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, when a dramatic tightening of immigration policy was followed by a failure to stop Vattenfall, the state power company,selling, rather than shutting down, its German coal mines. “One of the mistakes we made … was maybe to say that we would succeed in certain issues where it wasn’t possible, and that has haunted us,” she says, of the coal debacle.
As a result, the party lost roughly half of its 20,000 members, and then, in September’s election, a third of its seats. The party says, however, it always knew that power would come at a heavy price, and had aimed only to stay above the 4% threshold needed to keep its place in parliament.
I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious.
“It’s been a long-term strategy for the Swedish Greens to come into government and really take responsibility,” says Lövin. “We managed to do that and not be destroyed in the process.”
The Greens may yet have a role in the future Swedish government. Coalition talks have failed to lead anywhere and, last week, Annie Lööf, the leader of the minority Centre party, failed to form a government, the second such doomed attempt. Lövin believes her party is now in a strong position and could find a place in coalitions dominated by the centre-right Alliance bloc or the Social Democrats, whose leader, Stefan Löfven, was on Friday announced as the next person to be put forward to parliament as prime minister.
“It’s difficult to exclude any possibility at this point,” she says. “The Green party has been mentioned now as a very interesting partner for the more liberal rightwing parties, and of course we’re also included in what most people think would be a Social Democratic or more centre government.”
While some other party leaders have spent the last two months locked in coalition talks, Lövin has instead been busy serving as a minister in the transitional government, leading preparations for next month’s Katowice Climate Change Conference.
“I hope to be there,” she says. “I’m very concerned, actually, because with the Paris Agreement, everyone was very happy that we got to get an agreement, but now the logic of the climate negotiations is back to where it was before Paris, with the poor counties, including China and India, blaming the richer countries for what’s happening.”
Lövin’s press secretary then chips in to warn her that it’s time for her next appointment, but she has one more thing she wants to say. “I think one of the most important things for all democracies around the world to contemplate is how we are going to develop and protect democracy when voters are so impatient and learn their news from social media, which can be very biased.”
A viral tweet such as hers may get through to hundreds of thousands of people with a simple message about how wrong it is for a White House full of men to sign orders that affect women’s bodies and lives. It cannot, however, communicate more complicated, nuanced information.
“The understanding of long processes, which is, very necessary if you are going to have a democracy, not a dictatorship, is very low,” she says.
“I think just staying on very superficial messages and going with a populist movement is totally the opposite of what a green party should be.”",1265,1.9493177387914232e-4,1.9493177387914232e-4,1.9493177387914232e-4,0.04113060428849903,0.22046783625730992,0.03138401559454191,0.26530214424951265,0.0898635477582846,0.08011695906432749,0.2711500974658869,2018-11-24

The first-ever climate pact to enjoin all nations vows to cap global warming at “well below” 2C compared to pre-Industrial Revolution levels – and under 1.5 C if possible. 
“Currently we only have a few scenarios that get us there, and they are outliers,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in Paris, said of the more ambitious goal.
All but a few of the hundreds of complex computer models plotting the rapid reduction of greenhouse gases that drive climate change, in other words, zoom right past it.
“The 1.5 C target took the scientific community by surprise,” said Prof Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, which is hosting the three-day conference ending Thursday.
The question stretches back to the chaotic Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, which nearly derailed more than a decade of UN talks, set the threshold for dangerous global warming at 2C.
A huge body of scientific literature has accumulated around that benchmark, feeding into periodic reports by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
But a recent crescendo of devastating impacts – heatwaves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas – pushed world leaders to inscribe even more demanding temperature targets in the Paris pact, inked by 195 nations in December.
The effort was led by small island nations, some of which are likely to disappear under the waves within decades. 
Major emerging economies, notably India, went along despite fears that the new threshold would be a brake on economic development. 
On current trajectories, the world is set to warm at least 3C by century’s end, a recipe for human misery and species extinction on a global scale, scientists say.
The inclusion of 1.5C – even as an aspirational goal – was hailed as a political victory, especially by poor, climate-vulnerable nations.
But it caught the scientific community tasked with informing policy makers off-guard.
Top climate scientists gathered in Oxford to help fill this knowledge gap, and to funnel raw material for a major review – called for in the Paris agreement – to be delivered in mid-2018.
“The findings from our conference are going to lead directly into the evidence base for the IPCC special report on 1.5C,” Hall said. 
“The bad news is that we are already two-thirds of the way there,” he added, noting that average global temperatures in 2015 – the hottest year on record – were a full degree higher than 150 years ago.
Indeed, the 2018 report is likely to make for grim reading.
A 2C cap on warming was already seen as hugely ambitious, both technically and politically. 
For many scientists, 1.5C seems virtually impossible – at least not without “over-shooting” the target.
“We may see the first year of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within a decade,” cautioned Dr Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre in England.
For some scientists, even setting the target is a bad idea.
“There is a risk that the 1.5C temperature threshold is a distraction,” said Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research in England.
“The danger is that it will push us to look at geoengineering solutions rather than how to achieve deep decarbonisation.”
Slashing the output of greenhouse gases that heat the atmosphere and oceans – decarbonisation, in other words – has long been the preferred solution to global warming.
But despite a boom in renewables, emissions have continued to grow, putting even a 2C target out of reach unless engineers find ways to suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground – so-called “negative emissions.” 
The 1.5C goal depends on these geoengineering schemes even more, and could tempt policy makers to opt for “quick fix” solutions rather than a wholesale transformation of national economies, Anderson said.
The problem, scientists agree, is that few of these technologies have moved beyond the experimental stage, and those that have may pose new quandaries.
Schemes that depend on biofuels, for example, would – if scaled up sufficiently to make a real dent in CO2 levels – compete with food crops that scientists say must double in the next 30 years to keep up with an expanding world population.
“Radical changes will be required,” said Nebojsa Nakicenovic, deputy director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a major centre for climate modelling.

It’s May 2018, three years after representatives from nearly 200 countries convened in France in an extraordinary display of international unity and agreed to keep global warming below 2C and to pursue a tougher target of 1.5C.
How the Paris climate agreement will achieve that remains an open question. The rules to govern the deal are due to be agreed at the next United Nations climate change conference in the coal-mining town of Katowice in south-west Poland in December. With the clock ticking, diplomats have gathered in the former West German capital for mid-year talks. Things are not going well.
Negotiators rush in and out of adjoining rooms. In years gone by, Biniaz would have been at the centre of these meetings. From 1989 to early 2017, she was a deputy legal adviser at the US state department and its leading climate lawyer. She personally drafted key passages of the 2015 Paris accord. In global warming diplomacy, few are more respected. She still attends UN climate meetings, but only as an observer, with limited access to the behind-doors wrangling. So in Bonn she stands in a visible spot and the meetings come to her.
“Hi Sue!” calls out Chinese negotiator Xiang Gao, who is standing alongside Andrew Rakestraw, a Trump state department official and Biniaz’s former colleague. Beside these sharp-suited hotshots, Biniaz is an elder: rimless oval spectacles, grey hair loosely pulled back. They fill her in, cracking jokes and sounding hopeful about the stream of talks they are co-chairing. Biniaz writes something down.
Biniaz left the department in 2017 and took up teaching in the law schools of Columbia and Yale as well as a fellowship with the UN Foundation, a Washington DC philanthropic institution. She did so partly because she thought nothing as professionally enthralling as the Paris agreement could ever happen to her again. She also predicted, correctly, that the new president, Donald Trump, would renege on the deal. “I just did not want to be part of an administration that was going to take the position that this was a terrible agreement, because I don’t agree with that,” says Biniaz.
At the UN Foundation she shares an office with two former colleagues from the Obama state department climate team: Julie Cerqueira and Jen Austin.
Between them, Biniaz, Cerqueira and Austin cover the three arms of climate politics outside federal policy: international talks, local and state government, and the business sector. Austin is policy director for the We Mean Business coalition. Cerqueira leads the US Climate Alliance, an umbrella office for “subnational” governments who want to coordinate efforts to combat climate change.
Turnover between administrations is a great Washington tradition, as party devotees slip into the private sector, thinktanks or lobbying firms. But the exodus from the state department climate team has been different, says Biniaz.
“The number of people who have left has been kind of extraordinary and it’s definitely been not just because the administration changed, but it changed into an administration that was very hostile to both the Paris agreement and climate change action more generally,” she says.
Cerqueira says: “A lot of civil servants gave up their nice state department or [Environmental Protection Agency] job or whatever because they are so committed to addressing climate change as fast as possible.” She loved her state job and regrets deeply the change in policy that drove her out.
“You stay in the federal government as long as you feel like you can make a difference and as long as you feel like you can act in good faith and uphold your oath to the constitution,” she says, “and at some point you realise that you can’t do that any more.”
As a result, the most effective diplomatic and legal outfit ever assembled in global climate politics is now spread through the thinktanks and environmental organisations of Washington DC.
“Some people have been calling it climate diaspora,” says Biniaz. “It’s not an organised group. But to varying degrees we keep in touch because our work is related. Well, we keep in touch socially too of course, just because we are friends.”
The 2015 Paris accord drew up the global system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in only the broadest strokes. At just 27 pages long, it represents what could be agreed at the time. But interpreting the agreement into a concrete set of rules is proving an immensely complicated task. For example, the Paris deal asks all countries to submit their plans to fight climate change. But much is left open as to what those plans should cover, or how often they should be updated, using which metrics and baselines, and how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data. These questions can all be split into increasingly finer details, with such eventual complexity that in many negotiating parties, the lead diplomat has only a rudimentary understanding of what their staff are working on. Consensus is proving difficult to find.
If it is ever agreed, the “Paris rulebook” will iron out these technical, in some cases toxic, details. Without it, the deal will collapse.
It is over these troubled waters that Biniaz keeps watch in Bonn. Using intelligence harvested from old contacts, she keeps track of which parts of the talks are in most trouble. When they become stuck, Biniaz arranges small, informal gatherings of key negotiators to try to unblock them.
One evening Biniaz held an after-dinner session. “People are in a better mood when they are fed,” she says. Diplomats sat behind nameplates bearing their own names, instead of the name of their country. These meetings are private and completely off the record. Biniaz believes the relaxed setting can help adversaries “inch toward a point of view”.
Biniaz has hosted at least five such meetings, held with the assistance of the Paris-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), on the margins of the busy 2018 negotiating calendar. These have usually focused on the area of the talks Rakestraw and Xiang oversee, which covers what information countries must provide as they report their efforts to cut carbon pollution. The role is neutral, but there is one ironclad principle under which she operates: the deal cut in Paris is not up for negotiation.
There is an undercurrent at the talks that is disturbing the former US diplomat, who says there are serious attempts afoot to write rules Biniaz thinks “ignore the language” agreed in 2015.
Based on legal language Biniaz helped to draft, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping agreed to universal rules that gave flexibility for the poorest countries. That compromise is credited with making Paris possible. It was good for small, vulnerable nations that feared China’s gigantic future emissions. But for emerging, coal-dependent economies it was hard to swallow. Hence their efforts now to reverse the deal and the possibility that a dual deal could be reached in Poland under which China is subject to different rules than the US.
A group of developing countries, spurred by US betrayal and most likely coaxed on by China, are now trying to create one set of rules for the rich and one for the poor. This approach would govern China’s massive emissions more loosely, which would be unacceptable to the US and EU. If talks fail to produce a rulebook in Katowice over the coming weeks, it will be over this.
It does not help that US diplomatic influence over climate change has collapsed under Trump. Just three years ago the Obama state department, with Biniaz as its lieutenant, ran the show. The Trump administration diplomats who still turn up to negotiate are tolerated, but their power has evaporated.
As an Obama diplomat, Cerqueira built alliances between countries with similar interests. In her new job, the international experience has come in handy. As cooperation and dialogue on climate change with the US federal government has dried up, other – usually European – nations have sought diplomatic connections with governors and mayors across the US. Cerqueira is often their first call.
When the UK and Canadian governments began gathering names for a global pact to end coal power, she says, “they wanted to coordinate on the recruitment of states into the alliance and so we are like a natural fit”. So far, seven US states and two cities have signed up.
A short ride across town from the UN Foundation is the Brookings Institution, where Todd Stern has taken up a fellowship. If Biniaz was the driving intellectual force behind US efforts in Paris, Stern, as Obama’s special envoy for climate change, was its voice and face. His relationship with China’s lead negotiator and government minister Xie Zhenhua was a crucial factor when talks hit the skids in the final hours. The final draft contained a single word – some claimed it was a typo – the US found unacceptable. As the talks threatened to unravel, Xie stepped in, backed the change the US demanded and the gavel came down.
Unlike many of his staff, Stern had no intention of staying on after the Paris deal was struck. He had had enough of the constant travel, the time away from his three children. He began packing up his offices and in May 2016, after striking a final bargain with his old friend Xie for the US and China to ratify the agreement together, he departed. Like Biniaz, he had agreed to teach a course at Yale. He was thinking about writing a book: the story behind the global accord. He was not thinking much about the ongoing negotiation of the Paris rulebook; certainly he didn’t imagine getting involved. Then Trump won.
 “I really had been assuming that Clinton was going to win,” he says. Initially, Stern thought “wiser voices in the room” would convince Trump to remain in the Paris agreement. “Obviously that changed over time.” But he knew immediately that “it wasn’t good and we weren’t going to see anything like a bona fide climate change effort internationally or domestically”.
In September 2017, a few months after Trump had announced his intention to leave the Paris deal, Stern travelled to New York to talk to old contacts as they gathered for the UN general assembly. He wanted to find out what other countries were thinking. How would the negotiations on the Paris rulebook, so critical to its function, be conducted with US leadership stripped away?
Word of the binary system being pushed by China and its allies was circulating. This was something Stern and Biniaz believed they had buried in Paris. If US climate diplomacy has had a defining theme over years and across presidencies, it is that its great rival China must be bound by the same conditions. If December’s talks deliver a dual rulebook, it could stop the US rejoining the deal under a different president, says Biniaz. Neither Stern nor Biniaz denies that making sure this doesn’t happen is guiding their involvement. Six current and former non-US diplomats interviewed for this story said they thought this was at least partly their goal.
Certainly, Stern heard enough in New York to continue turning up. Over the past two years he has dropped in to most major meetings. He lunches and listens and tactfully gives his views. His book has made little progress.
His travels have included a visit to Beijing in May this year, where Xie hosted him at Tsinghua University. The two spent a lot of time together, says Stern, talking about the state of the negotiations.
“My lodestar is: what is the way in which we stay faithful to the Paris agreement?” he says. “Not what does the US want or not, because I can’t speak for the US, and it won’t come as a surprise to you that people aren’t all that interested about what the US likes or doesn’t right now.”
A senior diplomat from a developing country told the Guardian, speaking under condition of anonymity: “Some would say Todd and Sue are trying to keep the whole thing from crumbling. Others would say they are trying to keep some soft power for the US. Others could say they want to still feel relevant, or make sure that their vision of what the Paris agreement should be prevails.”
The US vision of the Paris deal is, broadly, what Obama’s state department got from Paris. They wanted voluntary targets, rather than ones that were in line with their historical responsibility for creating climate change. Once set, countries’ pledges could not be legally binding, or the US Senate would reject them. The world accepted the rule of the Senate. These priorities arguably weakened the power of the deal to cut emissions. Certainly the current paucity of these voluntary efforts (which are supposed to increase over time, at a pace determined by each government) means the world remains on a path to warming well beyond 2C.
 Meanwhile, Trump has argued that Paris “demeaned” the US; that Obama was stitched up; that China will go on building coal plants (it will) while the US cannot (it can, but doesn’t need them).
Despite Trump’s radical reversals of domestic climate policies and threat to withdraw from the deal, his state department still turns up to the negotiations. The US cannot formally leave the Paris agreement until 2020, coincidentally on the day after the next US election. 
The state department continues to advocate the same positions it has for years: common rules, non-binding, voluntary targets. A US department spokesperson said its priority was “to ensure a level playing field” – code for tying China to the same rules as all others. Of course, by flagging his intention to leave, Trump has significantly weakened his diplomats’ chances of protecting these goals.
Because of this, Obama’s most senior climate advisers, who devised great chunks of the Paris accord, are now working in the shadows to defend a vision of the deal that is broadly in line with the efforts of the defanged Trump state department. 
“It’s stupid to think that we would regard them [Stern and Biniaz] as the progressives,” says a former negotiator for a small island nation, noting that in Paris the US had been forceful in cutting off the most vulnerable countries on Earth from any form of reparation for damage they will incur from climate change. 
When countries meet in Katowice this month, Biniaz and Stern will be there. In the final days of the two-week marathon, negotiators will hit a wall. Issues they cannot agree on will be handed to ministers. At that point Chinese and US intransigence could hamper the Paris agreement. “Who will China’s climate chief Xie turn to in that moment?” asks Greenpeace adviser Li Shuo. Stern’s old job at the state department no longer exists. The US delegation will not have anyone at Xie’s ministerial level who knows the deal like Stern. 
For the most vulnerable nations on Earth, Trump’s election has had a little recognised, but insidious impact. In climate terms, it has shifted the emphasis away from improving the Paris agreement to defending it. Stern and Biniaz may well help rescue the deal, but will they want to make it more just?

It is fringed with a few bushes, has little soil and no supplies of fresh water. Yet this unprepossessing, seven-acre scrap of wave-washed granite is a site of major ecological interest. Thanks to research carried out here, scientists are gleaning invaluable – and alarming – data about the impact of climate change on the planet’s wildlife.
The project is the work of Steven Kress, a veteran ornithologist who constructed a sanctuary here for the Atlantic puffin 35 years ago. The puffin (Fratercula arctica), distinguished by its parrot-like, red-and-yellow bill, had been wiped out there by hunters in the 19th century. In the 1970s, Kress decided to bring them back.
“Puffins are monogamous, loyal and great providers for their young,” says Kress. “I was smitten by them.”
Some starve to death even though their parents are bringing them plenty of fish
Reintroduction was no easy task, however. The puffin is also a highly social bird and usually returns to its parents’ colony to breed after spending several years at sea. “We had to find a way to persuade them to settle on Eastern Egg Rock instead, ” says Kress.
The solution, he decided, was to use puffin decoys in the same way that wildfowl hunters employ decoys to attract duck and geese to their guns. One-foot-high wooden replicas were peppered round the island to entice young puffins to land, socialise and eventually breed with other curious puffins. After several years, Kress and his team succeeded, establishing a puffin colony on Eastern Egg Rock in 1981. It is one of only a handful of spots in the US where the species nests.
“At the time, our decoy plans were scoffed at. However, we succeeded to the extent that the technique is used today round the world to attract birds to new colonies. It is not so much the colour of the decoy that was important we found but the accuracy of its silhouette.”
In 1987, Kress was given a Rolex enterprise award for his efforts. This came with a grant of 50,000 Swiss francs which he used to extend his programme to other seabirds and other parts of the world. Today, there are around 1,000 pairs of puffins on Eastern Egg Rock and other islands nearby.
It is a remarkable success story. However, scientists working at the colony, which is supported by Audubon Society, have recently uncovered a worrying trend – a decline in puffin fledgling survival rates. Kress explains: “Most seabirds catch fish and then regurgitate them to feed their young. However, puffins drape the fish that they catch over their beaks before dropping them into the mouths of their chicks. They are like little fishing fleets going out every day before coming back with their catch of the day. Crucially, it is very easy to identify what they have caught. You can see it hanging from their beaks.”
This is the ocean’s equivalent of the canary in the coal mine
Because of this, Kress’s team have been able to study puffin diets in detail for several decades – and found the birds usually fed on hake and herring. Recently, however, there has been a change in puffin diet on Eastern Egg Rock. Herring has disappeared from the menu. Instead, parents are bringing home supplies of butterfish to the nest – with disastrous consequences.
“Butterfish are much rounder and much more difficult to eat,” says Kress. “Essentially the chicks cannot swallow them and some starve to death even though their parents are bringing them plenty of fish.”
Many chicks still make it to adulthood but suffer seriously reduced body weights which leave them less able to withstand the vicissitudes of sea life. Using data records for the past 20 years, Kress and his team calculate that fledging survival rates have declined by an average of 2.5% per year for those two decades.
As to the cause of this harmful change in diet, Kress points to the dangers posed by climate change. “As the Arctic heats up, seas in higher latitudes are getting warmer and warmer. As a result, populations of fish that normally thrive in more southerly waters are moving into these more northerly waters.”
The butterfish is an example and it is having a real impact on the puffin. Their chicks can only fit smaller, narrower fish, such as white hake –into their beaks and they have trouble swallowing larger, oval-shaped species like butterfish. The problem is made worse because puffin parents don’t tear up or partially digest the fish they catch for their young. “There is a YouTube clip of a young puffin trying, and failing, to swallow a butterfish,” said Kress. “The tragedy is that the puffins are surrounded by plenty of fish. This is the ocean’s equivalent of the canary in the coal mine. It’s telling us that climate change will not just affect the distribution of fish round the world but there could be disastrous consequences for many different species of wildlife that depend on these fish for food, such as the puffin.”",842,0.12428940568475452,0.023514211886304908,2.583979328165375e-4,0.6359173126614986,2.583979328165375e-4,2.583979328165375e-4,2.583979328165375e-4,2.583979328165375e-4,0.010594315245478035,0.20439276485788113,2016-10-02

There is a small group of researchers around the world working to understand the phenomenon known as “thunderstorm asthma”, which although rare, can have devastating consequences. Climate change, they say, may be where part of the blame lies.
On Sunday 20 people remained in hospitals across Victoria, struggling with respiratory and related conditions, while four remained in critical condition. At least six people are known to have died after their asthma was triggered during the thunderstorm, the health department confirmed over the weekend.
A major, state-wide investigation into the response of emergency services to the event has been ordered. 
Paramedics did the best they could to respond to an unprecedented 1,900 emergency calls in five hours on the evening of 21 November but were unable to reach everyone in a reasonable time. Ambulances made constant trips to emergency departments that were already overwhelmed as hundreds of patients streamed in under their own steam.
The acting general secretary of Ambulance Employees Australia, Danny Hill, says it would have been a traumatising night for paramedics.
“For anyone who worked that night, from staff on the ground to senior management, they regarded it as the busiest night they ever worked in their whole careers,” he says. 
“Very few crews got fed. They worked 14 hours straight. Everyone worked together, worked hard, and stepped up. There was about 30 people who were so severely ill that they had to be taken straight into intensive care. So you’re talking an event equivalent to a bushfire where people are severely burned, or a terrorist attack where people are critically injured.
“That’s the level of chaos our crews dealt with on Monday night.”
Asthma patients can be some of the most difficult for paramedics to respond to. They deteriorate very quickly, and severe cases require more than the immediate treatment a paramedic can provide, including continuous days of intravenous drugs and ventilation. Many, Hill says, went into cardiac arrest.
Kathy Bowlen from St Vincent’s hospital says the emergency department there had considered opening a temporary emergency department in the foyer of the hospital to cope with the demand.
While not the first case of thunderstorm asthma in Melbourne, it was the most deadly and the severe. What researchers don’t know is why sometimes a combination of high pollen counts and thunderstorms leads to a mass asthma event, while other times, those two factors combined have little impact on people’s respiratory health at all. What other factors might be playing a part?
What is known is that grass pollen is usually too big to get into the lungs to cause asthma, and instead causes a reaction in the superficial respiratory systems of those with pollen sensitivity: a hay fever reaction such as a runny nose, sore throat and itchy eyes are more common.
But when a thunderstorm occurs, pollen which had settled during the day can be swept back into the air and the moisture in those winds combined with wind power causes the pollen to rupture into smaller pieces, between 0.5mm and 2.5mm in diameter. Those small fragments are then able to penetrate the superficial respiratory system and get into the lungs, triggering asthma and other serious respiratory responses. 
Gennaro D’Amato is a professor of respiratory medicine in Italy and chairman of the World Allergy Organisation’s climate change, biodiversity and allergy committee. He is the world expert on thunderstorm asthma and one of the most published authors on the phenomenon in the scientific literature.
He has been monitoring thunderstorm asthma events throughout the world and says they have also been seen in London in Britain, Naples in Italy, and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.
A sudden and extreme asthma outbreak that occurred in London in June 1994 coincided with a heavy thunderstorm, D’Amato says. In the space of just 30 hours, 640 patients with asthma or other airway diseases attended London hospitals, nearly 10 times the usual number. For 283 patients, the storm triggered their first known attack of asthma. And for every patient that did seek help, many more suffered at home.
“Fortunately, even though it can induce severe asthma, outbreaks associated with thunderstorms are neither frequent nor responsible for a high number of disease exacerbations,” D’Amato tells Guardian Australia. 
“However, the mechanisms involved in the release of allergens from pollens during thunderstorm should be known so that patients can receive information about the risk of an asthma attack, including in those usually only affected by seasonal allergic rhinitis [hay fever].”
The frequency of thunderstorms has recently increased in some geographical areas, he says, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates. Research has shown that thunderstorms and their destructive winds are expected to become more severe as the climate changes.
D’Amato has found a number of characteristics common to all the asthma epidemics. Their occurrence is closely linked to thunderstorms, limited to late spring and summer when there are high levels of airborne pollen grains, and has an onset close to the arrival of the thunderstorm and to major rises in the concentration of pollen grains. People with hay fever and asthma and who stay indoors with windows closed during the thunderstorm are unaffected.
Those not undergoing asthma treatment are at major risk, his research has found. In the Melbourne epidemic on Monday, between 20% and 40% of those affected had never had asthma before, and so would not have been undergoing treatment.
Associate Prof Paul Beggs, an environmental health scientist with Macquarie University in Sydney, is best known for his research on climate change and its impact on allergens such as pollen.
Some research has found that the potency of pollen grains had been increasing, he says. Anthropogenic climate change through the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere could be responsible for this growing pollen potency.
Between 20 and 40% of those affected had never had asthma before, and so would not have been undergoing treatment
“Plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis,” he says. “It’s like if you change your diet, there are changes in your body. So plants use carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and if you change the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere then their growth conditions are changing.”
“A few smart scientists thought to put these highly allergenic plants into a glass house where we can control all the conditions, from the temperature to light, water and levels of carbon dioxide.”
What they found, he says, is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide leads to a whole range of changes in the plants, including more pollen and more potent pollen.
“All of these thing are happening in the background: climate change, increasing pollen potency, and they all mean a thunderstorm asthma episode is more likely than it was 20 years ago.”
Beggs is a researcher with the AusPollen Partnership, a multicentre cross-disciplinary team of investigators including eminent allergy physicians and scientists looking at pollen aerobiology and climatology. Their work is essential given Australia is the fourth worst country for allergic hay fever and asthma.
The principal investigator on that team, Associate Prof Janet Davies, says another factor researchers believe may trigger asthma is a sudden temperature change – which occurred in Melbourne on Monday as the temperature fell rapidly from 35C into the low 20s. But much more research and data is needed to understand the phenomenon, she says.
“The AusPollen Partnership is encouraging people to tell us about their symptoms and triggers, and free app downloads allow people to do this daily if they want to,” she says.
“That will help us understand regional patterns and, by integrating that data with geo-spacial data, will help us understand who is at greater risk and the threshold for triggering a higher risk.” 
The difficulty for researchers is that pollen monitoring, though extensive in Melbourne, does not go back far enough to help them develop a clear picture of all the factors triggering thunderstorm asthma. This would allow them to issue alerts when they could see a perfect storm of risk factors about to collide.
But Associate Prof Ed Newbigin from the school of biosciences at the University of Melbourne says thunderstorm asthma is going to be “a hard thing to get a handle on” because of the lack of data.
“The big question is why sometimes high pollen counts combined with thunderstorms sometimes trigger these asthma events and sometimes don’t,” he says.
“We need to understand what other factors work together if we want to reduce thunderstorm asthma. Because in Melbourne, high pollen counts and thunderstorms often coincide. But most of the time when they do, nothing happens.”",1429,0.5900914634146341,0.0062499999999999995,1.524390243902439e-4,0.12057926829268292,0.0016768292682926831,0.1510670731707317,1.524390243902439e-4,0.061128048780487804,1.524390243902439e-4,0.06875,2016-11-26

And Malcolm Turnbull’s central campaign pitch was buffeted in every direction on Friday.
Coalition strategists are sure that Britain’s shock Brexit vote will lure disillusioned and distracted voters back to the party usually seen as more capable economic managers. Turnbull was quick to link it to his message. But Labor strategists see an opening too, urging voters to question who the Coalition would look after in a time of economic crisis.
But even before the Brexit vote other factors were pressuring Turnbull’s stability v chaos message.
Questions about the marriage equality plebiscite saw the differences between Turnbull and the Coalition conservatives, which were supposed to remain out of sight until after the election, edge into the political daylight.
The camps reached a temporary truce after the leadership change last September, when Turnbull accepted (among other things) the marriage equality plebiscite he had so persuasively bagged and a deferral of any discussion about how to make the climate policy fit for purpose, and the conservatives retreated as his popularity initially soared and the government regrouped for re-election.
It suited both sides to put off a more definitive reconciliation: Turnbull because he hoped a decisive victory and a more workable Senate would further boost his authority and the conservatives because open dissent in the lead-up to an election would diminish theirs.
But now two things are putting that standoff under strain, exposing glimpses of the internal reckoning to come. A big, decisive Coalition victory is not assured, and a more workable Senate is highly unlikely. And as the policy cracks become visible, the voters are demanding answers. 
Throughout the campaign, Turnbull had swerved around the marriage equality question by claiming a plebiscite wasn’t his idea but rather one he inherited, promising he would push hard for a yes vote and extolling his belief in the Australian people to conduct the debate in a civilised manner.
But increasingly, the public isn’t buying that answer. Margaret Parkhill questioned the prime minister on Q&amp;A, making the quite reasonable point that he was prime minister and should be able to decide to change a wasteful and potentially harmful process that he disagreed with. Penny Wong, in a powerful lecture, smashed the notion that the debate could avoid harm.
“Not one straight politician advocating a plebiscite on marriage equality knows what that’s like. What it’s like to live with the casual and deliberate prejudice that some still harbour,” she said.
And the public is absolutely right to be sceptical. Not of Turnbull’s desire to do all he can to ensure marriage equality happens – that’s entirely genuine. But of the tactics being planned, including within his own party, to try to stymie that outcome. 
The conservatives have always seen a plebiscite as a means of avoiding or deferring marriage equality rather than enabling it. Turnbull simply asserts that the “yes” vote will prevail in the plebiscite, and that the parliament would then definitely vote for the change. “The consequence of a ‘yes’ vote in the plebiscite will be that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia”, he told parliament, as if saying it with conviction would actually make it happen.
But he can’t guarantee that. He conceded on Friday that Coalition MPs would have a free vote in the parliament after a national plebiscite had succeeded.
And crucial details, with a real bearing on that vote, have been so hotly disputed that the attorney general, George Brandis, shelved a final cabinet decision on the conduct of the plebiscite until after the election.
One of the most contentious issues was whether the Australian Electoral Commission would report the results of the national vote on an electorate-by -electorate basis – something that would allow MPs to vote against a national “yes” vote if their own constituency had voted “no”. 
And several have said this is exactly their intention. Andrew Hastie said so during the Canning byelection. Andrew Nikolic reportedly announced a similar intention at an election forum last week in Bass. Eric Abetz left open the possibility earlier in the year in an interview with Guardian Australia. Craig Kelly has also reserved the right to oppose same-sex marriage if his electorate voted against it. Cory Bernardi has said he won’t be voting yes under any circumstances. 
It seems logical that a national yes vote would encourage many MPs to back marriage equality in the parliament. They’d be enacting the will of the people. But think what pressure anti-marriage equality campaigners could bring to bear on MPs who support the idea but turn out to have electorates that aren’t certain. 
And then imagine what would happen to the authority of the prime minister, who has assured the nation that a civilised debate will lead to a yes vote, if in fact a bitter debate ends with a different outcome.
And there’s a similar crunch coming on climate policy. The Climate Institute asserted in its policy “report card” this week that it was feeling encouraged because “the Coalition, Labor, Greens and Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) now all support emissions trading”. It says this is a fact because it is what all those with deep interest in the policy are being assured will occur. 
But again, imagine if the prime minister who promised he would never lead a party that was not as committed to action on climate change as he was failed to deliver, if the conservatives were unwilling to allow the ramping up of the baseline and credit scheme that has always been embedded within Direct Action.
Exactly these imaginings are rippling through the ranks of the Liberal conservatives as they grind their teeth listening to their leader agree that the settlement of Australia was an “invasion”, and openly admitting he never wanted a plebiscite.
Last week the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, popped up to insert into the final weeks of an election campaign the helpful idea that Turnbull would come under pressure to reinstate Tony Abbott to his ministry. Turnbull slapped that notion down, saying his cabinet wouldn’t change.
So then Abbott did an interview with his friend Andrew Bolt (who recently editorialised about the “awful choice” facing conservatives as they contemplated voting for the “leftwing” Turnbull). The former prime minister deftly walked the line between overt destabilisation and making his point.
He was perfectly happy to serve as the member for Warringah, he insisted, but – when asked whether he would like to be defence minister, as has been widely reported, he replied “all sorts of things might happen in the future, but right now you’ve got to be content with serving your electorate”.
“I didn’t hear a ‘no’ in there Tony,” Bolt noted, and they both laughed knowingly.
Precisely because the polls are close, the truce will almost certainly hold until election day. 
And until then Turnbull will run the line that the greatest threat to political and economic stability and certainty is a Labor government dependent on the votes of the Greens.
But, unless the published polls are wildly inaccurate, a re-elected Turnbull government would be dependent on the Senate votes from the Nick Xenophon Team as well as a number of a difficult-to-predict bunch of Senate independents, possibly including Pauline Hanson, Jacqui Lambie, Derryn Hinch and Bob Day, which doesn’t exactly look like smooth sailing. 
And, simultaneously, it will have to wrangle its own internal reconciliation with conservatives, emboldened by the likelihood that, while Turnbull might have delivered a victory that looked impossible under Abbott, he hadn’t turned out to be all that popular after all.
Perhaps the uncertainty of the Brexit vote will convince voters that Turnbull really does offer predictability and stability.
But the truth is, whatever his own intentions, they can’t really be sure that’s what he’ll deliver.",1297,1.6977928692699492e-4,0.0035653650254668934,1.6977928692699492e-4,1.6977928692699492e-4,0.6657045840407471,0.01035653650254669,1.6977928692699492e-4,0.01035653650254669,0.04261460101867572,0.266723259762309,2016-06-24

The ad comes as a survey revealed 93% of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by the bleaching. That finding motivated the Queensland government to call on the federal government to convene an urgent meeting of the nation’s environment ministers to talk about measures to address climate change in light of bleaching.
Organised by the Climate Council, the full page ad in the Courier Mail on Thursday contains an open letter signed by 56 scientists. 
“One of the reasons we placed the ad in the Courier Mail was that we’ve seen very little coverage of the coral bleaching event in that paper and in fact there was a front-page story that said the coral bleaching event had been wildly exaggerated,” said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland and one of the signatories of the letter.
The letter explains that it is the worst bleaching event in its history, and that it is being driven by climate change.
“The Great Barrier Reef is at a crisis point,” the scientists say. “Its future depends on how much and how quickly the world, including Australia, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit ocean warming.”
It then calls for Australia to rapidly phase out coal-fired power stations and for no new coalmines.
“This must be the top priority for Australia if we are to protect what remains of the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around the world,” they say. 
Climate Council member and signatory to the letter Lesley Hughes said: “We are now seeing first-hand the damage that climate change causes, and we have a duty of care to speak out.”
On 7 February, the Courier Mail ran a story quoting the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, as saying the reef remained an untouched beauty. His comments were in response to a David Attenborough documentary about the Great Barrier Reef being aired.
“The key point that I had from seeing the first of the three parts is that, clearly, the world’s Great Barrier Reef is still the world’s Great Barrier Reef,” Hunt told the Courier Mail.
The story included a subheading that read: “Reports of reef’s death greatly exaggerated: Attenborough”.
A News Corp Australia spokesman said on Wednesday that the claim there had been very little coverage of coral bleaching in the Courier Mail was “frankly baffling”.
“A quick Google search shows numerous stories have been published including, to highlight just a few, on March 1st, 21st and 30th. And today the paper has covered the issue extensively once again,” he said.
“Equally importantly the paper also exposed Greenpeace’s dishonesty in using deceptive imagery on two separate occasions. Such scare campaigns only serve to undermine the efforts to secure the reef’s future.” 
A story about the 93% bleaching appeared in Thursday’s paper on page 13.
The Queensland environment minister, Steven Miles, called for an urgent meeting with Hunt, and said “we have to move quickly on climate change,” and bemoaned the “lack of a coherent effective national policy.”
“The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has been downplaying the seriousness of the coral bleaching because he knows the major cause is global warming and we still haven’t seen any meaningful climate change policy from the federal level,” Miles said.
The Queensland government itself has been criticised for approving Adani’s Carmichael mine, which would be Australia’s largest coalmine. Federal approval of the mine will be challenged in court this month, on the basis that emissions released when the coal is burned will threaten the Great Barrier Reef.",609,3.3112582781456954e-4,0.003642384105960265,3.3112582781456954e-4,0.2420529801324503,0.34139072847682117,0.2950331125827814,3.3112582781456954e-4,0.07649006622516556,3.3112582781456954e-4,0.040066225165562915,2016-04-20

This week, governments from around the world will meet in Bonn for the next round of UN climate talks. The Paris climate change agreement, which was signed by 195 countries in December 2015, included a commitment to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2C … and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels”.
A lot has happened since then. We have witnessed the shameful decision of the president of the United States to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Average global temperatures have risen to more than 1C above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change, have had devastating impacts, leading to loss of life and severe destruction in the US and the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia and as close to home as Ireland.
We believe that churches and other investors can and should support the shift from fossil fuels to clean alternatives through their investment policies. Although the Church of England divested from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands in 2015, it continues to hold significant investments in major oil and gas companies.
While many of us believe that the church should divest from all fossil fuel companies for ethical reasons, we are especially concerned about its continued investment in the US oil and gas company ExxonMobil.
A recent Harvard academic study shows that Exxon knew about the risks of climate change in the 1970s, yet misled the public for decades. It says that the company sought to cast doubt on the climate science, taking out paid editorials in major US newspapers questioning whether global warming was real and caused by humans. Exxon’s board of directors has advised shareholders to vote against all resolutions on climate change since 1990.
The financial risks of investing in fossil fuels are also increasing. A recent Carbon Tracker report, 2 Degrees of Separation, showed that five out of six major oil and gas companies are risking more than 30% of potential investments – with a value of $2.3 trillion – on projects that are not aligned with the Paris agreement targets. ExxonMobil risks wasting between 40% and 50% of its future spending.
Time is running out to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. While some governments and companies pursue policies that are leading us in the wrong direction, the Church of England is uniquely placed to show moral leadership through its investment policies.
Now is the time for decisive action. We call on Church of England investors to take the lead and immediately divest from ExxonMobil.

Until now, there’s been something of a leadership void. Anyone who so much as uttered the words “climate change” might find me looking up at them, awaiting instruction.
Now I feel like I can pick and choose. Perhaps it’s because people are competing with Greta Thunberg, the teenage agitator behind the climate strikes, but good adults are stepping into the limelight.
My latest climate crush is Dr Mae Jemison. Despite being famous for spending time in space – she became the first African American female in space in 1992, serving as a mission specialist on the space shuttle Endeavour – she is all about tackling climate change, on Earth and doing it now.
The funny thing about astronauts is that they are rare in everyday life but abundant on the climate circuit. Even I’ve met five. They are particularly prized for their “blue marble” moment, the point at which they glimpse the Earth from space. Their macro-perspective gives us some indication of where our micro-actions can help. But what I particularly rate about Jemison (and she is not one of those I’ve met) is the fact that her main message is essentially “get over yourself, human”. The Earth will carry on without you, so get focused on making sure you’re not ejected.
Last week, as part of a panel at Women in the World in New York, alongside Oprah Winfrey, she also kicked into touch the idea that we might up sticks and move our chaos to space when our tenancy here ends due to bad behaviour. “We must not use Mars as our Plan B,” she said.
Similar climate perspective was shown by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano Lliuya (another of my personal climate leaders) when he filed a lawsuit against RWE, the German energy giant, alleging that its immense emissions threatened his family, his property and his home city of Huaraz, 6,500 miles away.
The case recently entered the evidentiary phase before the higher regional court in Hamburg. That might sound like a boring bit of process, but it’s of fundamental significance. The Lliuya case shows that everyday people can take on big emitters. It’s the David and Goliath showdown of our time. At the last count, 1,302 climate lawsuits were progressing through legal systems across the world. Some of them will win and change the stakes.
I’m wary of raising false hopes, but I think we may have found the purpose of Instagram. @ PreachersNSneakers takes a forensic look at the apparel choices of a clique of celebrity preachers that has coalesced around Justin Bieber.
Since Bieber embraced evangelical Christianity a few years ago, celebrity-connected pastors have entered the mainstream. These include Chad Veach, sometimes referred to as “Bieber’s pastor”; Carl Lentz, who apparently baptised Bieber in an NBA player’s bath; and one Rich Wilkerson Jr, who officiated at the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. They amass huge audiences and Instagram followings and rock Bieber-inspired wardrobes.
Scrutinising the pictures of pastors at work has reaped rich rewards. Rather literally, the most expensive spot being a pair of Air Yeezy 2 “Red Octobers” worn by pastor John Gray, with a resale value of $5,611. This has raised questions over what the good lord might make of such materialism and whether a megachurch pastor should be a hype-beast.
Under fire over his $1,980 Gucci backpack and $794 Traxedos track pants, Chad Veach is the only man of (expensive) cloth to attempt a comeback so far, posting that he didn’t pay for his outfit. He quickly thought better of it and deleted it.
As with all trends propagated by social media, we should be wary of contagion. I recommend UK clergy restrict themselves to modestly priced Hush Puppies, with typical orthopaedic support. The last thing we need now is Rev Alan from The Archers attempting to hide his Yeezys under his cassock.
Hey, Jude Law, how does it feel to get a 100% approval rating? That’s what I’d ask at the end of the week when images of the actor filming (The New Pope) in white budgie smugglers generated meltdown.
It goes deeper than the prurient. Timing was important: Brexit day 9,000 or trunks? But the images also delivered meme heaven and played into a weird trend for objectifying priests (thanks, Fleabag).
But the unexpected element was how we felt about Jude. He’s been in our lives for many years. He’s had bad times and indeed bad films. But we’ve always rooted for him. “Has anyone in the history of humankind reacted to losing his hair better than Jude Law?” asked writer Joe Reid as we gloried in Jude’s buff pontiff snaps.
It’s not all sunlit uplands. Jude’s briefs have launched a hundred beach-body-ready guides increasing body image pressure on men. They will generate beachwear angst. “Holiday get-up for men is tricky territory,” advised the Telegraph, which is understatement of the year if you’re proposing tight white trunks. My advice – do not go there.
But Jude did, and he gave us a day off and broke the internet, so well done.",862,0.0026894865525672372,0.017359413202933983,0.08581907090464548,2.444987775061125e-4,0.01002444987775061,0.03936430317848411,0.01002444987775061,0.08337408312958436,0.11271393643031785,0.6383863080684598,2019-04-13

Speaking at a candidates’ forum hosted by the local environment group Lighter Footprints at Hawthorn Arts Centre on Thursday night, Frydenberg said the project still had to pass nine more approvals after the environment minister, Melissa Price, granted the latest approval on Tuesday, of which he said the “most fundamental” were with the Queensland government.
“In this case on the water issue, we took the advice of the CSIRO, of Geosciences Australia, and that is why it has gone to the next stage,” he said.
Labor has indicated it may push for a review of the approval decision because the timing of the election announcement meant a planned estimates hearing where the CSIRO would explain the extent of its advice did not go ahead.
The Adani coalmine is expected to cause difficulties for Frydenberg in Kooyong. Of the six candidates at the forum – also there were Labor’s Jana Stewart, the Greens’ Julian Burnside and the independents Oliver Yates, Bill Chandler and Angelina Zubac – he was the only one who did not criticise the project.
About a quarter of the 260 questions submitted by the audience in the packed venue were about Adani.
Yates, a former Liberal party member and chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, said the project had lost all social licence.
“For a government that represents its people and for a member who represents this audience to be continuing to support a project that its electors in this area do not support is an extraordinary position for a local member to take,” he said.
Burnside said suggestions that voters in Kooyong would vote solely on economic rather than environmental issues was “a mark of the contempt with which the Liberal party see this electorate”.
“They can’t even imagine the possibility that this electorate would turf them out.”
He dismissed concerns of sovereign risk over the Adani project as “a meaningless expression as a matter of law”.
“I would say if there’s a contract which Adani could enforce I would hold to account those members of the outgoing Liberal government who signed the contract,” he said.
Yates, Burnside and Chandler had the strongest support from the crowd.
Stewart said she “personally [didn’t] agree with Adani” but that Labor would take a “balanced approach”, prompting Chandler to hop to his feet and step from side to side, saying: “This is Labor jumping from one foot to another on Adani, they keep moving on it all the time.”
At a separate climate change forum in Mildura, the Nationals candidate for the western Victorian seat of Mallee, Anne Webster, engaged in some heavy product differentiation from her Queensland party colleagues.
“The only people I’m beholden to are the voters of the Mallee electorate,” she said.
“Some of you possibly thought I would come tonight and talk about climate change not being real … I want to assure you that I make up my own mind, have my own opinions and I’m not afraid to stand up to others.”
While four independent candidates at the forum emphatically panned the Adani project, Webster said: “Renewables ought to be our focus.”
She said she would not be afraid to cross the floor of parliament on a range of issues.
Webster is seeking to continue the Nationals’ hold over the seat after it was vacated by Andrew Broad following allegations of inappropriate conduct during an official government trip overseas.
The forum was divided on whether there needed to be a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, with Webster and the independent Cecilia Moar, a former farmer, opposed, and the independents Jason Modica, Allen Ridgeway and Ray Kingston in support.",633,0.024315068493150682,3.4246575342465754e-4,0.014041095890410958,0.010616438356164383,0.7948630136986301,3.4246575342465754e-4,3.4246575342465754e-4,3.4246575342465754e-4,0.017465753424657532,0.13732876712328768,2019-04-11

The home secretary, who is positioning himself for a run at the Conservative party leadership, made a series of tweets condemning “any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law”.
He called on the police to “take a firm stance” against protesters who were “significantly disrupting the lives of others”.
“Over recent days, commuters trying to earn a living have been unable to travel to work and businesses have been disrupted,” he said, following a meeting with Met police chiefs.
“Emergency vehicles have faced difficulties navigating the road networks and the demonstrations have put added pressure on police officers whose job it is to solve crimes and protect the public.
“Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law. They have no right to cause misery for the millions of people who are trying to lead their daily lives. Unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated.”
Hundreds have been arrested and more than 1,000 officers deployed to police the protests, which entered their fourth day on Thursday.
Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate.
They said demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest but said there was no legal justification for more draconian tactics, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful.
Politicians have struggled to respond to the protests, as they are keen to head off complaints that not enough is being done to tackle climate change at the same time as taking a tough stance against disruption to commuters.
Javid and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, have come under pressure from the rightwing press in recent days to take a more outspoken stance against any protesters disrupting public transport or acting illegally.
In a letter to the home secretary, Khan suggested that cuts to funding were restricting the ability of the Metropolitan police to cope with the activists.
“The Met’s ability to police protests without impacting on core policing priorities – such as tackling knife crime – has been made significantly harder by the huge cuts to government police funding,” he said.
Citing £850m of cuts to the force since 2010, he added: “Whether to tackle violent crime, or police protests, our brave police officers deserve the resources they need to keep us safe.”
He highlighted the increasing cost of policing a growing number of protests in London, and said he was working with the Met to consider claiming for a special grant to help with costs for the current demonstrations.
He has said on Twitter that the world is “facing a climate emergency” and that he “fully supports the right of protesters to protest on this vital issue”, while urging organisers to “work with police to ensure their demonstrations are peaceful and lawful and that disruption is kept to a minimum”.
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said: “We’ve got the message,” after some activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to a garden fence at the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
Claire Perry, the energy and climate change minister, also said that she “got the science, motivation and passion driving climate emergency protests” but could not see that “disrupting one of world’s busiest transport systems … blocking emergency routes and making life difficult for so many is going to build consensus and support for the changes we need”.

The politically connected founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power, who has approached the Morrison government to underwrite new coal developments in Victoria and New South Wales, including a high-efficiency plant on the site of the AGL-owned Liddell power station, told the ABC on Wednesday Debelle’s intervention was out of order.
The RBA deputy governor on Tuesday noted businesses and policymakers needed to consider climate change as a trend and not a cyclical event, and said climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be “close to permanent” if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often.
St Baker responded by suggesting Debelle lacked technical understanding of how the electricity market worked. He said Australia was a world leader in the uptake of wind and solar, and declared “wind and solar cannot support an electricity supply system’s voltage and frequency”.
“The Reserve Bank governor, the speeches they are making, are totally inappropriate,” he said. “The fact is in an island community, you must have at least 50% at any time of the electricity demand being supported by what we call synchronous generation, that is 24/7 power: nuclear, gas, coal-fired, or baseload hydro.
“We don’t have any of those except coal as an economical source that we build a business on, and for the Reserve Bank governor to be entering the debate now, at a time when we have university students supporting, schoolchildren supporting, a strike to go 100% renewable in Australia by 2030 – it’s just part of the problem – especially at election time”.
In a separate interview on the ABC, the resources minister Matt Canavan – who has been a forceful advocate inside the government for new coal developments – also defied recent comments from Scott Morrison, declaring there was a “clear need for additional power in north Queensland”.
Morrison said earlier in the week the government was not contemplating coal plants in Queensland – which is what a number of Queensland Nationals, including Canavan, want – because a new plant would never be approved by the state government.
Canavan told the ABC: “There is a clear need for additional power in north Queensland, multiple studies have shown that, and those studies come back always saying that a Hele [high efficiency plant] or a new coal-fired power station would make a lot of sense in north Queensland”.
St Baker’s company signalled it was interested in buying the ageing Liddell plant in 2017 when the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly castigated AGL, the plant’s owner, for wanting to close the facility in 2022 and replace it with a combination of renewables and gas. But despite the sustained political pressure, AGL has shown no interest in selling the asset.
After growing frustration with energy companies, the government last year produced the so-called “big stick” package which created a power to break up energy companies if they engaged in price gouging, which some energy experts have long suspected was a mechanism to remove Liddell from AGL’s ownership.
The government was forced to pull the package because it would have to cop a Greens/Labor amendment in the House that would prohibit taxpayer support for new coal-fired power. But rebel Queensland Nationals want it back on the agenda before parliament rises.
While Liberals in city seats remain concerned that the government risks losing the coming election, at least in part, because of its record on climate change, Nationals are keeping up the pressure for new coal developments.
The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has confirmed the Morrison government is continuing to assess new coal-generation projects despite pushback from moderate Liberals, but he says taxpayers will only support projects that are “viable”.
St Baker told the ABC on Wednesday he had brought three potential projects to the government for taxpayer underwriting – a pumped storage project in South Australia, coal projects in Victoria, and a replacement power station on the Liddell site in New South Wales.
St Baker said he believed replacing Liddell with a new high-efficiency plant “using all that infrastructure” was the “best solution” if Liddell had to close. He said the projects would be 70% debt financed and 30% equity.
He said the government had indicated if projects could secure commercial and industrial customers on five-year contracts it would provide a taxpayer-backed guarantee for the project.
Taylor told Guardian Australia on Wednesday the government would only back projects that were “viable”.

Our walls aren’t made of stone, but constructed from something different.
February saw record-high winter temperatures in the UK, defined by the burning of Saddleworth Moor and our supposed leaders truanting during the first climate change debate in two years. Juxtaposing these events reveals this country’s moral blindspot. While we still give airtime to climate deniers and delayers, fuelling debate as though the concrete causes of climate change are no longer based in science, we fail to stare at the real wounds festering around us.
We built walls around our empire, constructed out of colonialism, exploitation and imperial greed, with little regard for the enclosures we created. But history is permeable. It isn’t bound to classrooms, but something we are exposed to every day. We absorb the global narrative our country refuses to recognise, through the shared lives of activists, environmentalists and anyone with a phone and a voice. This narrative is composed from interweaving stories, the voices of a movement unrestricted by walls. Through this lens we are able to reshape our history, but only by first addressing our present. To remain ignorant is to remain immune to blame. It creates disconnection. This is why we need climate justice.
There is a reason why teenagers and children have been chanting, “System change, not climate change”. The system is fundamentally at fault, and our leaders fail to recognise that. They are trapped behind yet another wall of their own construction. It prevents them from seeing the connection between our actions and their leadership.
The Youth Strike 4 Climate movement isn’t just unprecedented, it’s also reforging fractured connections. Going across borders, trespassing upon political nuance laid out by generations before us, young people from around the world are weaving a new social fabric in which climate justice is our connecting force – a sledgehammer to the walls around us. Connections like these form as we reclaim our social media spaces. By building platforms for young activists to share their stories – whether they be of those living among cyclones in the Pacific or political danger in Brazil – the internet can be restored as a place for unfiltered intimacy with things that matter, revealing the reality of climate change for those living it. And, in creating a social network based on the values of internationalism and solidarity, we subvert the system of competition and separation permeating our lives.
In ant colonies, large populations are sustained through the interactions between individual ants. There is little centralised authority in the most resilient colonies. On social media, teenagers have also been swept up in self-organisation, spreading their message from group to group, country to country, with the only central authority being the collective fear we all share.
We are redefining political space and challenging the idea that social media platforms are only uncontrollable forces beyond our control. Instead, we’re creating tools to change the world, but on our own terms. As the power of far-right groups grows online, the digital presence of the Youth Strikes campaign fosters a sense of community that is more like systems of interdependence in the natural world than the walled enclosure of traditional politics. The self-organising power of the strikes and our closeness to others miles from us provides a new alternative. We’re not separate from each other and we are not separate from nature.
We need those in power to act with urgency and new ideas, but we also implore them to address the causes of the crisis. In order to truly repair the climate, we must recognise the system of inequality that has caused its collapse. Britain, while it might not be the biggest carbon emitter in the world, has a responsibility to act, given its historical role in creating the crisis we find ourselves in. Our society is built on the coal-fuelled industrial revolution; we now export our consumerist emissions abroad while providing lines of credit and finance to the destructive industries ravaging through other lands. Our economic model is parasitic, with little regard for people or the planet. Competition, consumerism and separation fundamentally disrupt the patterns of nature. They are the causes of its impending collapse.
Until we recognise our role in climate justice, we will be forever controlled by these forces. Our governments must look to the Youth Strike movement to learn a new way forward. Our movement is fuelled not only by anger, passion, fear and intelligence, but also by a deep understanding of the connectivity of all humans – and humanity’s relationship with the planet. In breaking down the walls of communication, new voices have emerged to define a politics for the future.

After the US National Parks Service was temporarily banned for retweeting images comparing Trump and Obama’s inaugurations, the official Twitter account of the appropriately named Badlands National Park, based in South Dakota, appeared to go rogue by posting a series of now-deleted tweets on climate change.
The tweets were eventually deleted, and, while the official accounts may not be saying much right now, some “alternative” accounts have been set up. One, @BadHombreNPS tweeted: “Hey, friends. Here to support @BadlandsNPS with the science facts they can no longer share!”

One of its initial tweets read: “Mr Trump, you may have taken us down officially. But with scientific evidence &amp; the Internet our message will get out.”
The owner of the account has yet to respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, but told reporters:

As of yet, it has not been verified whether the account is actually run by National Park employees. Eagle-eyed tweeters noticed the account had tweeted about the British general election in 2015. 
@WingsScotland Oi, fellow plebian. What say you, honourable rev, on the elecshun result?
A National Parks official told BuzzFeed the climate change tweets were posted by a “former employee” who was not authorised to use the account.
They added: “The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realised that their account had been compromised.”
This isn’t even the first time National Parks Twitter accounts have run afoul of the Trump administration. Over the weekend, they were temporarily told to halt tweeting after its main account retweeted pictures comparing the turnouts of Trump and Obama’s inaugurations. They later apologised for the “mistaken RTs”.

Authors say the expansion of tribal land rights is the most cost-effective way to protect forests and sequester carbon – an issue that they hope will receive more prominence at the upcoming United Nations climate conference in Marrakech.
The paper by the Rights and Resources Initiative, Woods Hole Research Centre and World Resources Institute aims to encourage governments to recognise indigenous land rights and include tribal input in national action plans. Currently this is not the case for 167 of 188 nations in the Paris agreement, including Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are home to some of the world’s biggest forests.
It is also likely to feed into a growing debate in Brazil, which has won kudos for recognising more indigenous land than any other country in the past decade but is now under a new government that has yet to be tested in international climate talks.
Based on satellite surveys of 37 tropical countries, the study estimates community-claimed lands sequester at least 54,546m tonnes of carbon – roughly four times the world’s annual emissions.
Ownership of a 10th of that land is public, unrecognised or contested, which raises the risk that it could fall into the hands of developers, farmers, miners or others who want to clear the forest for short-term financial gain at the expense of long-term environmental costs. 
The authors argue there is a greater economic benefit from leaving the property in the hands of traditional residents and strengthening their ownership rights so they can protect the land. 
Alain Frechette of Rights and Resources, one of the report’s authors, urged national governments and negotiators to make indigenous communities a more central part of climate policies. 
“When communities have secure forest rights, not only are forests better protected, but communities fare better. It’s what economists call an optimal solution. Everyone wins,” he said. “By contrast, large-scale development initiatives produce quick wins, but the long-term environmental, economic and political costs are not taken into account. They are just pushed on to future generations.”
“As well as reducing 20-30% of carbon dioxide emissions, the forests provide benefits of clean water, pollination, biodiversity, flood control and tourist attractions that are said to be worth $523bn to $1.165tn in Brazil, $54-119 bn in Bolivia, and $123–277bn in Colombia over the next 20 years.
The data shows the most important region is Latin America, where 58% of emissions come from deforestation, more than double the global rate of 24%. Without protection, much more could yet be released. Five of the top 10 countries for forest carbon are in the continent. Brazil with 14,692 megatonnes has twice the amount of the next biggest country, Indonesia. 
Having expanded indigenous land considerably since 2003, Brazil – and later Bolivia and Colombia – initially slowed deforestation. The World Research Institute estimates that tropical forests without such protection were two to three times more likely to be cleared. 
But in recent years, forest destruction in Brazil has started to creep up again and many environmentalists are worried that the new centre-right government of Michel Temer could accelerate this trend. 
Since the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff in September, the new government has cut the budget for the National Indian Agency (better known by its acronym Funai), and removed many of its key personnel. 
“There are causes for concern,“ said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. She urged Brazil not to backtrack. “As this report shows, if Brazil enhances its respect for indigenous peoples’ rights, they will be able to contribute more to the Paris agreement. It will be to their benefit. They can measure that in terms of the amount of tonnes of carbon that are being conserved.”
Paulo Moutinho, director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, called on the new government to declare the 71m hectares of currently undesignated public forest – equivalent to all the land cleared in the past 40 years – protected or indigenous land. 
Although he acknowledged that this would be difficult to push past the strong agribusiness lobby in congress, he said farmers would eventually realise that strong forests were necessary not just for the global climate but for local rainfall patterns and irrigation. 
“There is still time to do something impressive,” he said. “The world expects strong action from Brazil. It would be nice to consolidate and expand protected areas. Otherwise, it will be impossible to achieve what we have promised to the world.”",802,0.028316326530612244,0.14311224489795918,0.005357142857142857,0.2732142857142857,0.002806122448979592,0.061479591836734696,0.4033163265306122,0.002806122448979592,0.0691326530612245,0.010459183673469387,2016-11-02

The NSW land and environment court ruled last week Gloucester Resources’ Rocky Hill coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley should not go ahead, in part because of its social impact on the town of Gloucester and because a new coalmine was not compatible with Australia’s commitments under the Paris agreement.
The planning commission has been considering plans by the South Korean company Kepco for an open-cut mine in the Bylong Valley, north-east of Mudgee.
Late last year, the NSW department of environment and planning recommended the development be approved subject to strict conditions and referred it to the commission, which is due to make its decision soon.
The proposed mine has been debated by farmers, environmentalists and residents, who have voiced concerns about the social impact, the greenhouse gas emissions from a new coal development, and also whether rejecting the mine could hurt employment in the region.
The Rocky Hill decision was a “fantastic shot in the arm for us”, said Phill Kennedy, a farmer who lives in the Bylong Valley. “The Rocky Hill proposal was minuscule compared to Bylong, which is five times the size in terms of the emissions.”
Lawyers who acted in the Rocky Hill case for community group Groundswell Gloucester said the Bylong Valley development had similarities to their case. 
In his judgment, Chief Judge Brian Preston said a new open cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley “would be in the wrong place at the wrong time”.
David Morris, the chief executive of NSW Environmental Defenders Office, which acted on behalf of Groundswell Gloucester, said there were a number of proposed mines being assessed in the state that “should now logically follow the approach outlined by Chief Judge Preston”.
“The one to my mind that is the closest comparison to the Gloucester project is the Bylong Valley mine,” he said. “This is another scenic valley, it’s another greenfield coal project. There’s a whole raft of aspects of this decision in Rocky Hill which would seem broadly applicable to the project proposed in the Bylong Valley.”
Morris said other proposals where the case could prove relevant were Whitehaven’s Vickery extension project, Peabody’s Wambo joint venture and the Hume coal project.
Gloucester Resources has 28 days to decide if it will appeal the court’s decision.
The NSW Minerals Council has rejected the suggestion the case will have widespread ramifications.
“We’ll take a close look at the judgment, including what appears to be a range of different reasons for the outcome,” said Stephen Galilee, the council’s chief executive. “However, we don’t believe this is in any way a ‘landmark case’, given the department of planning had already recommended against the approval of the project.”
But George Woods, the NSW coordinator of the anti-mining action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said communities would be looking to the Independent Planning Commission for “leadership and direction” in the wake of the court’s decision.
“Bylong is the very next decision the commission will make about a new mine,” she said. “What we’d hope is this judgment would prompt the commission to seek advice that would put the emissions from Bylong in the context of a carbon budget consistent with meeting the Paris agreement.”
Brendan Sydes, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, said the Rocky Hill case was “dramatically different in the sense that every argument that has been successfully put forward by mining companies in the past has been completely considered, discredited and rejected”.
He said that included considering the impact of emissions from coal that was exported and burned elsewhere, as well as the argument that if coal was not dug up and burned from one mine, it would simply happen somewhere else.
“We now have this anomalous situation that the most up-to-date and thoroughgoing analysis of the impact of new coalmines by an Australian court has adopted reasoning in a manner that’s inconsistent with the reasoning that has been adopted to support the approval of the Adani mine,” Sydes said.

The funding, to be unveiled on Sunday and confirmed in the May budget, follows a recent study finding that 30% of the reef’s corals died in a catastrophic nine-month marine heatwave in 2016.
The government will partner with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in a $444m agreement to tackle crown-of-thorns starfish, reduce pollution and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
The government will increase funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Department of the Environment and Energy by $56m to expand environmental management and compliance operations.

Both of the major parties are currently focused on winning hearts and minds in Queensland, with the state’s marginal seats likely to determine the outcome of the next federal election.
The Coalition has been criticised by environment groups for not acting fast enough to protect the reef, and the government’s support for the Adani coalmine has also been controversial both locally and nationally because of its potential impact on the reef.
In January Guardian Australia revealed that millions of dollars of commonwealth money was being handed to tourism-linked groups for reef protection, despite official advice recommending against the projects, or repeatedly finding them to be failing.
Earlier this year, the head of the United Nations environment program warned the battle to save the world’s coral reefs was at “make-or-break point”. Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture.
In a statement issued in advance of Sunday’s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it.
“Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,” Turnbull said. “A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our reef the best chance.”
Turnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours.
“As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,” the prime minister said.
The funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health.
The study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – published in April – examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.
It found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals. It said “initially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks”.
“These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”",564,0.07083333333333333,3.205128205128205e-4,3.205128205128205e-4,0.4362179487179487,0.28557692307692306,3.205128205128205e-4,0.19262820512820514,3.205128205128205e-4,3.205128205128205e-4,0.01314102564102564,2018-04-28

Here’s what happened in politics this evening:
A new report outlining the first National Drug Control Strategy was released today, just as new director Jim Carroll was sworn in to his role heading the White House’s National Drug Control Policy. 
The department’s priorities center heavily on combatting the opioid epidemic, and reducing drug-related deaths. Along with the report, the agency launched a new multimillion dollar media campaign targeting young adults and teens. 
From CNN: 
The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to get a hold of Oxycodone and Vicodin — from smashing their hand or arm, to wrecking their car or breaking their back”. 
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, agreed to by Russia and the US to stop both nations from developing and deploying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missies may be dissolved at the end of this week, after negotiations failed today. 
Breaking: @SecPompeo expected to announce Friday US will suspend participation in Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) arms control treaty with Russia that has been a centerpiece of European security since the Cold War - @kylieatwood @NicoleCNN reporting
Reuters is reporting that a the six-month withdrawal process will likely move forward on February 2 unless the Russians admit and amend their alleged violation of the agreement:
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson on Thursday held last-ditch talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Beijing ahead of the expiration on Saturday of a U.S. 60-day deadline for Moscow to return to compliance with the treaty.
Thompson and Ryabkov said afterwards that the two countries had failed to bridge their differences. They met on the sidelines of a meeting of the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - all nuclear powers.
European officials are concerned about the treaty’s possible collapse, fearful that Europe could again become an arena for nuclear-armed, intermediate-range missile buildups by the United States and Russia”.
In a statement issued by the NATO Foreign Ministers in December, which was updated today, the INF Treaty was described as “crucial in upholding NATO’s security for over 30 years”. Russia, the allies concluded, violated the pact by developing a missile system that poses risks to European countries:
 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia, when Russia’s actions make that possible. As most recently confirmed at the Brussels Summit, we remain open to dialogue with Russia, including in the NATO-Russia Council. We call on Russia to return urgently to full and verifiable compliance. It is now up to Russia to preserve the INF Treaty”. 
Russian leaders have vehemently denied the allegations, and on Wednesday President Vladamir Putin threatened the US with an amping up of nuclear arms should the treaty fall apart. 
“Now it seems our American partners believe that the situation has changed so much that the United States must also have such a weapon,” Putin said on TV in Moscow. “What’s our response? It’s simple: in that case we will also do this”. 
ABC News is reporting that the identities of the blocked-number phone calls with Donald Trump Jr around the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 have been revealed to be NASCAR CEO Brian France and developer Howard Lorber, two close friends of the Trump family who publicly and financially supported his campaign. 
The three phone calls with Donald Trump Jr. to blocked numbers in June 2016 have until now fueled questions about whether Trump Jr. informed his father about the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting before or after it occurred. The controversial meeting between high ranking members of the Trump campaign and an ensemble of Russians has been a source of intense interest from investigators seeking to determine whether the campaign worked in concert with agents of the Russian government to impact the election”.
Today the Trump campaign shared that they have raised more than $21 million this quarter and that most of the contributions came in small doses. According to a press release published by the President’s team, 98.5% of the funds came from donations of $200 or less. 
Trump has, throughout his first term, raised unprecedented amounts of money and claims to have $19.2 million in cash on hand to start 2019. Comparatively, President Obama had raised $4 million with $2.3 million on hand by 2010, when he was at the same point in his first term, and George W. Bush raised $3.2 million with $2.8 million on hand in 2002. 
Just a day after Trump insulted his intelligence chiefs saying they should “go back to school” for contradicting his foreign policy priorities in an on-camera testimony to Congress, the president is now claiming they were misquoted by the media. 
....I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page!
On Tuesday, a team of top intelligence officials including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray outlined the biggest threats to the US for the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
They diverged from the President’s claims in several key areas and described what they believe actually poses the greatest risks to American safety. They cited Russia and China among the biggest threats, saying the two countries were becoming more aligned and could continue to use cyber attacks to disrupt US elections, and said North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons. They also negated Trump’s claims of victory over the Islamic State — which prompted him to announce a highly disputed and controversial troop withdrawal from Syria — and told Senators that ISIS still commands thousands and could have a resurgence.
 The testimonies were televised and transcribed, but Trump insists his team was taken out of context. 
As Trump tries to misconstrue the testimony from his intel chiefs, remember that not once did they, in hours of discussion of security threats, mention the need for a wall along the southern border, which Trump has portrayed as the single most pressing need facing the country.
Progressives are preparing to take on Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz — who is considering a run for president in 2020 as an independent — hoping to arm themselves with information about the billionaire’s governmental dealings. 
Axios reports that Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has requested documents from roughly 70 national and state agencies who may have connected with Shultz or his coffee company over the last 3 decades:
The group is gathering as much potential opposition research as they can on Schultz and his business in anticipation of his decision to possibly run for president as an independent. This is yet another example of liberals trying to push Schultz out of the 2020 race before he begins, in part because they view his candidacy as a “threat” that could be “a major step toward re-electing Donald Trump,” Priorities USA communications director Josh Schwerin told Axios”.
“While we hope he reconsiders and this never needs to be used” Schwerin said, “Priorities is sending out a full round of FOIA requests ... as a start to our research efforts combatting his potential candidacy.”
A new poll released by Monmouth University says more than 60% of Americans think the president knew that high-ranking members of his campaign lied to investigators and half believe he asked them to do it. 
The survey also found that there’s still significant concern among the electorate that Russia has influence over Trump, and that not enough has been done to stop the Kremlin from meddling into elections.

“After a number of indictments and guilty pleas, there’s a pervading sense that Trump was aware that others were trying to cover up his business dealings or what his campaign may have known about Russian meddling in the 2016 race”, Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute said in a statement released with the results. 
But, the results are still heavily divided along party lines:
‘Views of the president’s ties to Russia look like almost any other aspect of public opinion related to Trump. Very few Republicans believe anything negative about him and nearly all Democrats are inclined to accept damaging information, while independents are almost evenly split’, said Murray.
Just over half of Americans (51%) feel that the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference and possible links to the Trump campaign should continue. Another 45% say this investigation should be brought to an end. Support for continuing the special counsel investigation has hovered between 52% and 54% in polls taken between April and November 2018. Prior to that, about 6-in-10 Americans supported continuing the investigation (60% in March 2018 and 62% in July 2017)“.

Today Facebook and Twitter announced that hundreds of accounts and groups with links Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, appear to have been part of coordinated influence operations with aims to perpetuate anti-West views. 
From my colleague Julia Carrie Wong: 
Facebook removed 783 pages, groups and accounts that it said posed as local actors in countries across Europe, the Middle East and South Asia and shared content that was largely repurposed from Iranian state media. The accounts, some of which had been active since 2010, had garnered about two million followers on Facebook and more than 250,000 followers on Instagram...
...Separately, Twitter announced that it had deleted thousands of “malicious” accounts from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The accounts had “limited operations” targeting the US midterm elections in November, the company said, and the majority were suspended prior to election day.”

The Senate overwhelmingly backed an amendment this afternoon that argued the continuing presence of ISIS in Afghanistan and Syria is a threat and requires a continued military presence. The vote is a rebuke for Trump who is seeking to withdraw U.S. forces from both countries.
A well-known skeptic of the seriousness of climate change will join the Environmental Protection Agency’s science advisory board. Alabama climatologist John Christy has been a favorite of Republican lawmakers who disagree with the science that shows humans are heating the planet and causing an environmental crisis.
Christy was a lead author of a section of a 2011 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But that year he testified to a House panel that “it has become popular to try and attribute certain extreme events to human causation.”
“The Earth, however, is very large, the weather is very dynamic, especially at local scales, so that extreme events of one type or another will occur somewhere on the planet in every year,” he said.
International scientists have warned that climate change will cause more heat waves, stronger storms, and more erratic weather.
In 2014, in a column he co-authored in the Wall Street Journal defending his views, Christy said scientists at one time had achieved consensus that the Earth was flat. 
The Trump administration’s picks for EPA science boards have been controversial, as they have removed scientists who received agency grants to conduct research and replaced them with more representatives from industry and state government. The panels review the research EPA uses to make major decisions about protecting public health.

Democrats are revisiting how they approach social media and a digital operation in advance of the 2020 presidential campaign. 
As McClatchy reports:
As the 2020 Democratic presidential primary gets underway, the current and potential White House contenders are trying to connect with supporters online, convinced it’s an essential way to gain an advantage in what could be the biggest Democratic field ever.
These public, seemingly lighthearted moments reflect something going on behind the scenes, where strategists — racing to adjust to power of social media — are grappling with how to build a digital-first operation that can cultivate an online army. That could mean radical changes to the personnel and organization of the campaign itself — including a fundamental rethinking of traditional roles in areas such as communications and fundraising.
“I’ve been talking through that with a lot of people,” said Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “Do you even have a digital department anymore? It’s complicated.”
“We don’t talk about having a telephone department,” he added. “We don’t talk about using telephones anymore. We need to get to the same place in digital where it’s just seamlessly part of everything we do.”

The “greening government commitments”, which began when David Cameron declared he would lead the “greenest government ever” in 2010, were intended to deliver big cuts in carbon emissions, domestic flights, waste and water usage. 
Efforts fell short on all counts, though the reductions that were achieved still saved taxpayers £185m in the last year.
Ministers have been heavily criticised for cuts to a swath of green policies, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, and a leaked letter in November revealed the government is not on track the meet the nation’s EU obligation for green energy in 2020.
“Ministers’ failure to hit almost all of these targets means a bigger bill for taxpayers and more damage to the environment,” said Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary. “If the government can’t even cut its own pollution footprint, how can anyone have confidence they will cut Britain’s?”
“The government has still managed to save £185m in energy, waste and water costs, showing that environmental protection makes economic sense too,” said Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth. “The government must end its relentless attacks on green issues and make the reduction of the nation’s environmental footprint a top priority.”
Ministers had targeted a 25% cut in carbon emissions from government buildings and travel in 2014-15, compared to 2009-10, but achieved 22%. The failure was largely due to the Ministry of Defence, which accounts for half of all government emissions and cut its emissions by 19%.
Emission cuts came largely from improved energy efficiency and accounted for 90% of the money saved. But the government recently cut plans to improve energy efficiency in people’s homes by 80%. George Osborne’s Treasury, often blamed for the government’s anti-green moves, cut its own emissions by 56%, one of the largest savings.
More than 169,000 domestic flights were taken by government officials in 2014-15, unchanged from the year before. This represents an 18% cut compared to 2009-10, but falls short of the 20% target.
Just eight of 22 departments met the target, while domestic flights by environment department staff actually increased and those from the culture department more than doubled. Health department flights plummeted, however, by 62%.
Waste reductions also failed to improve last year, with the overall cut at 22% compared to the 25% target. The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s waste went up by 18%, while that at the Department for Education fell by 62%.
On water use, just six departments managed to meet the good practice benchmark set as a target and 12 of the 22 departments met a target on transparency on the steps they were taking to be greener. But the government slashed its paper use by 38% overall, far above the 10% target.
“While the headline achievements may fall slightly short of the targets set for 2014-15, the picture at department level shows that many departments are meeting and exceeding targets, while others are recording valiant reductions in face of significant operational challenges,” said ministers Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart in a foreword to the report.
A spokesman for the environment department said: “Following this success we are developing a new set of greening government commitments to see how we can go further, making the UK even greener.”
But Bennett criticised the government for missing its targets. “This says everything about the incompetence of this government when it comes to protecting the environment,” he said. “For months ministers have been systematically undermining national efforts to tackle climate change, and now we learn that they’ve failed to meet a whole range of green targets for their own performance too.”",614,3.333333333333334e-4,0.5469999999999999,3.333333333333334e-4,3.333333333333334e-4,0.16033333333333333,3.333333333333334e-4,0.117,0.17033333333333334,0.003666666666666667,3.333333333333334e-4,2016-01-11

Although just between us, I may have lost a bet to climate seer Joe Romm because he correctly predicted 2015 would blow 2014 out of the water. Instead, this is a post about the probability that temperature records keep getting broken if climate change is natural. 
A paper just published in Nature Scientific Reports by Michael Mann and Stefan Rahmstorf and their colleagues considered this question. In particular, they wanted to know how likely recent temperature records and the string of records would be if the climate was completely driven by natural variations. Not even including the crazy-hot 2015, what did the authors find?
Well it depended on the “record” they looked at. For instance, the likelihood that 13 of the hottest 15 years would be in the past 15 years is 1 in 10,000. The likelihood that 9 of the 10 hottest years occur in the past decade is 1 in 770. The results are similar regardless of whose temperature dataset is used.
Some media stories reported that the temperature records were even more unlikely. The reason this study arrived at different results is that they took into consideration the fact that temperature records are not like coin-flips. Each year is not independent of another year or the prevailing situation. 
For instance, there are natural events that alter the temperature such as volcanoes, variations in the solar output, or even internal variability such as the La Niña/El Niño cycle. If climate change were all natural, you could get these natural events to align just by chance, and this could give a naturally-occurring record. So, while it’s very unlikely that this could occur, it is much more likely than if we just treated each year as a coin flip.
The authors then asked how likely it would be to have a string of records given the reality of human-caused warming. They found that it’s 83% likely that 9 of the last 10 years would be the hottest on record and 76% likely that 13 of the past 15 years were hottest on record. They also found that the odds of 2014 being the hottest year on record was 40%. Without human influences, that chances 2014 would have been the hottest year is approximately 1 in a million. Mann said:
The press reports last year about the unlikely nature of recent global temperature records raised some very interesting questions, but the scientists quoted hadn’t done a rigorous calculation. As a result, the probabilities reported for observing the recent runs of record temperature by chance alone were far lower than what we suspected the true probabilities are.
Although the new odds of producing recent runs of record temperatures by chance are greater than the odds previously reported in the news (between 1 in 27 million and 1 in 650 million), they’re still incredibly slim at between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 170,000. Including the data for 2015, which came in after the study was completed, makes the odds even slimmer. 
In calculating the odds, the previous reports did not take into account that the data did not end simply because December 31 occurred, but that trends overlap into previous and subsequent years. This needs to be taken into account to determine the real probabilities of chance causing the warming events. As Mann noted,
We provided a method for doing this based on combining information from state-of-the-art climate model simulations with the observational temperature record, and we used this method to estimate the probabilities correctly.
 Rahmstorf added:
2015 is again the warmest year on record, which adds even more weight to our findings. What is more, the anomalous warmth has led to unprecedented local heat waves across the world - sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires.

His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.
Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, such as south Florida and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet’s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world’s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.
“We have been too slow in acting on climate change,” he told the Observer. “In particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming – like ice sheet and glacier melting – are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.”
In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. “With hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.”
These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the Paris climate talks last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: “It has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the Kyoto protocol, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.”
In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved – in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example – would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.
Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. “Apart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,” says Stern. “The consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.
“We are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.”
As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogotá have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. “We have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,” says Stern.
But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure – roads, buildings, ports and airports – that will more than double what already exists.
The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. “If it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.”
Last year’s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month’s talks in Marrakech. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives – but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created “by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive” and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern’s response is diplomatic: “It would make things very much more difficult,” he says.
Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 – despite the “policy wobbles” of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the Green Deal to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. “To behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,” says Stern. “That is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government’s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor’s autumn statement.”
The proposed new runway for Heathrow is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 – if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. “However, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK’s targets are altered – as I believe they should be – to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,” adds Stern.
The Paris agreement remains central to Stern’s sense of cautious optimism. “It was the honesty of the delegates’ awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement’s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.”",1362,0.14037162162162162,0.3515202702702703,0.01875,0.008614864864864864,1.6891891891891893e-4,0.023817567567567567,0.358277027027027,0.0035472972972972975,0.039020270270270274,0.05591216216216217,2016-11-06

Ben van Beurden said it would be a major challenge to limit temperature rises to 1.5C (equivalent to a rise of 2.7F), which a landmark report from the UN’s climate science panel has said will be necessary to avoid dangerous warming.
“You can get to 1.5C, but not by just by pulling the same levers a little bit harder, because they are being pulled roughly as fast and as hard as we are currently imagining. What we think can be done is massive reforestation. Think of another Brazil in terms of rainforest: you can get to 1.5C,” he told an oil and gas industry audience in London.
“It’s not what some people sometimes think: we’ll just do a little bit more solar, a bit more wind and we’ll get there,” he added.
Reforestation is seen as essential in the scenarios outlined this week by the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change, if the world is to restrict warming to 1.5C.
But Van Beurden stressed that meeting the challenge would be an uphill battle, because while it was “technically about doable”, it would not be commercially viable without changes to government policies and regulation. “Already to get to less than 2C will be [a] quite unimaginable, unprecedented scale of collaboration. Getting to 1.5C is a major challenge on top of it,” he said.
But the Shell chief executive was adamant that gas, which makes up a growing share of the firm’s portfolio, would have have a role to play in a 1.5C world.
“You can have an endless discussion about semantics. Is it a transition role, a destination role? In the end it is a bit of both,” he told the Oil and Money conference.
He said observers should not mistake headlines on the company’s forays into low-CO2 projects as a sign it was “going soft” on oil and gas.
In the past year, Shell has made investments in electric car infrastructure firms, offered support to the government bringing forward its proposed ban on new petrol and diesel car sales and bought up one of the UK’s biggest electricity and gas suppliers.
Van Beurden said renewables would become a bigger part of what the company does in future, but it could only move as far as society did.
“That means Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas,” he said.
Separately, Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) said there was no doubt gas would be a fuel of the future, even with tough climate targets. “We believe natural gas will continue to play a key role, not as a so-called transition fuel but rather in our view, a destination fuel,” said Saad al-Kaabi, chief executive of Qatar Petroleum.
The state-owned company recently announced plans for a significant expansion of its LNG production and exports, which account for nearly a third of the UK’s gas imports.
Kaabi said it was difficult to believe in the IPCC 1.5C report if it did not spell out the cost of hugely reducing the world’s reliance on gas. But he denied he was being dismissive of the report. “My comment is it doesn’t make sense that you could get rid of so much [oil and gas] volume unless you give me a solution that is different from just renewables,” he said.",581,4.065040650406504e-4,0.46788617886178857,0.2605691056910569,4.065040650406504e-4,4.065040650406504e-4,0.016666666666666666,0.21178861788617886,4.065040650406504e-4,4.065040650406504e-4,0.04105691056910569,2018-10-09

Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who led the historic Paris agreement of 2015, said: “There is nothing opaque about this new data. The illustrations of mounting impacts, the fast-approaching and irreversible tipping points are visceral versions of a future that no policy-maker could wish to usher in or be responsible for.”
A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment.
The scientists found:
• By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C.
• Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C
• Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds.
• If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost
Figueres said the need for urgent action was clear: “Emissions reductions today are much more important than emissions reductions tomorrow. The sooner we bend the curve of global emissions, the more options we will have on the table for safely reaching the necessary, desirable and achievable carbon neutrality by 2050.”
The decisions taken in the next few years will be crucial because the investment cycle for power plants and transport systems is at least 10 years. Infastructure built now will continue to burn up carbon for decades to come if it is not re-engineered.
“This is the decisive decade,” said Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International and co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, which warned of a domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile. “Any investment in energy has a 10-year lifecycle. Even a family car: 1.5C has become real.”
“Climate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,” he told the Guardian. “This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.”
Business leaders and investors pledged their support. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, representing financial investors with $21tn in assets, called on governments to provide the framework necessary to spur greater finance. “The IPCC has delivered a stark message. To limit global warming to 1.5C requires an urgent acceleration in the pace at which we are moving to a low-carbon economy,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s chief executive. “Governments now have to raise their ambition levels to implement the Paris agreement and provide the signals required for the clean energy transition.”
Peter Bakker, the president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, added that the effort would require “unprecedented funding and coordination”, with the private sector playing a key role. “It’s time to put real money next to real solutions, [with] different players from different sectors together driving forward.”
Politicians are expected to respond later this year, when governments meet in Poland in December to flesh out the ways of meeting the goals set out in the Paris agreement. Progress on this step of implementing the agreement has been slow so far, the UN has warned. Although all of the world’s functioning governments are signed up to the Paris goals, the US under President Trump has begun its withdrawal, making it harder for supporters of the agreement to move forward in the talks.
Jim Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who testified on climate change to the US Congress in 1988, the year the IPCC was formed, told the Guardian: “I have faith that they will act, eventually. The US, which has done twice as much as any other nation to create the excess CO2 in the air today, is the key. The executive and congressional branches will not, on their own, solve the problem. The courts will have to force the other branches of government to be responsible.”
Rockström said the political shifts in some countries should be met with a counterbalancing move in others. “Every time we get leaders in the US or Brazil taking a step back then others, particularly in Europe, should take a step forward.”
The UK is set to continue to pursue the Paris targets after Brexit, when the country’s emissions cuts will no longer count towards the EU goals. “There is now no excuse and real action is needed,” said Claire Perry, the minister for energy and clean growth. “This [IPCC] report should act as a rallying cry for governments around the world to innovate, invest and raise ambition to avert catastrophic climate change.”
The government is set to ask the Committee on Climate Change to advise on how the UK can meet its share of the emissions cuts needed to avoid 1.5C of global warming. The committee’s targets are binding on ministers.
Civil society groups are also piling pressure on policymakers to turn warm words into action. “The difference between impossible and possible is political leadership,” said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser on climate change at WWF. “We are already seeing loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice caps, rising sea levels, impacting on our health, livelihoods and economic growth. We know what is needed and we can do it relying mostly on proved technologies, such as decisively scaling up renewable energy and halting deforestation.”
Rachel Kennerley, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, added: “Just like ignoring credit card statements, so that repayments only become sharper and steeper, this report shows that weak responses will make it harder in the long run.”",1016,0.11018329938900204,0.15295315682281058,0.010386965376782077,0.051120162932790224,2.0366598778004074e-4,0.0735234215885947,0.574541751527495,2.0366598778004074e-4,0.02260692464358452,0.004276985743380856,2018-10-08

The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City announced plans on Friday to take diesel cars and vans off their roads by 2025.
Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, led the initiative at the C40 conference of mayors on climate change, taking place in Mexico this week. She said: “Mayors have already stood up to say that climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face. Today, we also stand up to say we no longer tolerate air pollution and the health problems and deaths it causes, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens.”
“Soot from diesel vehicles is among the big contributors to ill health and global warming,” added Helena Molin Valdés, head of the United Nations’ climate and clean air coalition, noting that more than nine out of 10 people around the globe live where air pollution exceeds World Health Organisation safety limits.
Miguel Ángel Mancera, mayor of Mexico City, said increasing investments in public transport would also help clean the city’s air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giorgos Kaminis, mayor of Athens, said his goal was to remove all cars from the city centre. The city authorities will also work with national governments and manufacturers, and promote electric vehicles and cleaner transport.
Recent research has uncovered the scale of the problem, with 3 million premature deaths a year attributed to dirty air, as well as millions of other illnesses, particularly in children.
Green campaigners welcomed the announcement, saying it showed that it was possible to clean up big cities. 
Alan Andrews, lawyer at the NGO ClientEarth, whose legal victory has forced a UK government re-think of air pollution plans, said: “This shows political leaders across the world are waking up to the damage diesel is doing to our health. But 2025 is a long time away when you consider the 467,000 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Europe [alone] every year.”
He called on other leaders to “go further and faster [with] bold new measures”.
Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, added: “This bold move to get rid of diesels, the most polluting vehicles, is exactly what is needed. We need cleaner vehicles and fewer of them. Getting rid of diesel is essential and we must also give people genuine alternatives to driving.”
She also called on London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to phase out diesel vehicles from the city by 2025, and for new clean air zones in all of the UK’s cities and major towns, with funding taken away from roads to promote sustainable alternative transport.
Diesel fuel use is a key cause of air pollution in cities, as the engines produce nitrogen dioxide, a harmful gas, and tiny particulates that can lodge in the lungs. These forms of pollution can also interact with other substances to create, in some conditions, a toxic soup.
Yet diesel use has been rising in many countries, partly for economic reasons and partly as a consequence of measures to combat climate change – diesel vehicles burn fuel more efficiently than conventional petrol engines, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It is not clear whether diesel vehicles in the four cities will be subject to a total ban, or what areas of the cities will be covered. Some cities already have measures in place intended to reduce congestion and clean up the air, such as low-emission zones that involve traffic restrictions.
Last year, the Volkswagen Group was engulfed by scandal when it was discovered that some of its diesel cars contained technology to disguise the true level of their harmful emissions.",611,3.1645569620253165e-4,0.07943037974683545,0.6427215189873418,0.0034810126582278484,0.0034810126582278484,3.1645569620253165e-4,0.22183544303797467,0.03512658227848101,3.1645569620253165e-4,0.012974683544303795,2016-12-02
