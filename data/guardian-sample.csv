5cc16d04a2c36151699897be,article,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/17/fossil-fuel-lobby-to-declare-interests-at-un-talks,Michael Slezak,1,Environment,"Climate change, Environment, Australia news, World news, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Oil, BP, BHP, Business",10,1494999237000,1518627587000,NA,200,Fossil fuel lobby could be forced to declare interests at UN talks,Developing countries score significant victory for greater transparency from outside parties at UN climate negotiations,"A push from developing countries to force fossil fuel lobbyists taking part in UN climate talks to declare their conflicts of interest has won a significant battle against resistance from the world’s biggest economies including the European Union, US and Australia.
The UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) has agreed to enhance “openness and transparency” for outside parties and will accept submissions from any stakeholder – which could be any person or group affected by climate change or climate change policy – on how it could do so.
“The result was pretty good – understanding that the world’s largest economic powers were adamantly opposed to anything to do with integrity or conflict of interest at all,” said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International, which has been running a campaign on the issue.
Since May 2016, Ecuador and Venezuela – on behalf of the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries that represents that majority of the world’s population – had been fighting to have a conflict of interest policy introduced where groups with “observer status” must declare their conflicts.
Organisations that have observer status, and can therefore attend meetings and walk the corridors of the conferences, include industry groups that represent all of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and BHP. Many of them have lobbied against policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In May 2016 at a UNFCCC meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate said the Paris agreement was an “instrument between states” and made a “moral request” that lobbyists should have to declare conflicts of interest.
The move was successfully opposed by rich nations, with the US, EU, Norway and Australia leading the battle.
But the issue was raised again in November at COP 22 in Marrakech and continued this month in Bonn where the Australian ambassador for the environment and lead delegate to the UNFCCC, Patrick Suckling, championed the role of fossil fuel companies in helping to craft climate change policy.
“Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy, they will be, some of them, the providers of the biggest and best solutions,” Suckling said. “And you could look at some of the statements coming out of ExxonMobil and Shell recently to underline that point.”
ExxonMobil famously hid their knowledge about climate change for decades and investigations have revealed they continue to fund efforts to manipulate public discussions of climate change.
On Tuesday, in a closed-door meeting in Bonn, the discussion continued with the US and Australia fighting to remove any language that included the phrase “conflict of interest” or “integrity”. The Guardian understands the US delegate argued that the US and Ecuador had “divergent views” on what integrity meant.
The US, New Zealand, Australia and the EU also opposed Ecuador’s moves to call for a reporting process, where stakeholders could submit their views on developing a conflict of interest policy, or on a way of improving the “integrity” of the UNFCCC’s engagement with non-party stakeholders.
But on Tuesday in Bonn, Ecuador successfully negotiated an agreement that committed the UNFCCC to enhance the “openness, transparency and inclusiveness of the UNFCCC process” and another that called for stakeholders to submit their views on how that could be achieved.
As a result, the discussion will continue in a year’s time, with the input of anyone who submits their views through the UNFCCC website.
The discussions appeared to shake-up the fossil fuel lobby, with some organising side events at the Bonn meeting to defend their role at the UNFCCC.
Stephen Eule, a climate analyst at the US Chamber of Commerce – a group with observer status at the UNFCCC – led one meeting where he spoke of the need to engage the coal industry; described the US commitments under the Paris agreement as “unrealistically ambitious”; and approvingly described Donald Trump’s moves to dismantle Barack Obama’s environmental regulations.
Eule said the Paris agreement was “lopsided and puts the US at a competitive disadvantage”, saying he expects the Trump administration to negotiate “to get a better deal for the US”.
In a piece published on a US Chamber of Commerce website, Eule defended the role the body plays in the the UNFCCC processes, saying it would continue to “look after the interests of our members and speak out on the issues that concern us”.
According to a Corporate Accountability International report, the US Chamber of Commerce has received millions of dollars from ExxonMobil for “public information campaigns” and executives from Peabody Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Sempra Energy sit on its board of directors.
“As longs as your business model depends on extracting and burning fossil fuels, you have no place helping to craft climate policy,” Bragg said. “Your profit incentive is going to keep you from doing the right thing. And, frankly, corporations have a duty to maximise profits – so they would be in violation of their shareholders if they were doing anything but.”",803,2.6246719160104987e-4,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.07112860892388452,2.6246719160104987e-4,0.09212598425196851,0.005511811023622047,0.48582677165354327,0.02125984251968504,0.3230971128608924,2.6246719160104987e-4

It’s starting to poison the natural world. So what is to be dung?","Recent research has estimated that by 2030, the planet will be generating at least 5bn  tonnes of poo each year, with the vast majority being deposited by livestock. With 80% of farms in the Netherlands already producing more cow dung than they can legally use as fertiliser, and China resorting to drastic measures to try to reduce the amount of manure being discharged into rivers, scientists say this is a major environment and health challenge.
“It’s a huge problem,” says Joe Brown, professor of environmental engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. “Animal waste is going up because as populations and wealth increase, there’s a bigger demand for protein. But while we’ve seen lots of initiatives to safely manage human waste, nobody is talking about this.”
Despite extensive Environmental Agency regulations, the UK’s dairy, poultry and pig farms were responsible for 424 incidents of serious pollution related to waste disposal between 2010 and 2016.
With the UK’s cows already producing 36m tonnes in waste every year – enough to fill the Shard 78 times over – and many dairy farmers feeling the pinch from tumbling milk prices, safely disposing of these mounds of toxic mess is a serious and expensive conundrum.
Because most first world farming systems are highly concentrated, industrial operations, this produces very concentrated streams of waste. Unless these are dealt with rapidly, they can pollute the air with large amounts of harmful gases such as ammonia, nitrous oxide and hydrogen sulphide.
Inhaling these toxic fumes can be lethal in large quantities, and studies have repeatedly shown that people who live near industrial farms have a much greater risk of chronic asthma, respiratory irritation, immune suppression, and even mood disorders.
Water pollution and climate change are also issues.
Moreover, the greenhouse gas methane is produced in large quantities when waste is left to decay uncontrollably. Many scientists believe animal waste is already a vastly overlooked component of climate change. “When methane is first released, it’s around 80 times worse than CO2 at trapping heat, and that continues for 10-20 years until it becomes oxidised and its global warming potential is reduced,” says Philip Longhurst, a professor at Cranfield University’s centre for climate and environmental protection. “When you look at sources of methane emissions across Europe, agricultural waste is probably in the top three.”
In China, where production of animal protein increased nearly five-fold as part of its dramatic economic growth between 1980 and 2010, methane from animal waste is thought to be one of the main reasons why greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere doubled during the same period.
So far, it’s the impact of manure on waterways that has received the most attention. This either occurs through accidental spillages, flooding or farmers deliberately dumping excess waste into rivers. Investigations have found that the latter practice is still commonplace, despite being illegal in many countries.
The ecological consequences are typically drastic, with the high levels of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates in manure leading to the spread of waterborne pathogens, and the growth of harmful algal blooms. The latter can poison wildlife by releasing deadly neurotoxins, and if they become widespread in fresh and marine water, they can end up getting into the food chain and being consumed by humans.
As an example, in China, more than half the freshwater lakes have become polluted, which has led to the rise of diseases such as cholera in many rural communities. Unless more effective ways are found to deal with the increasing amounts of animal manure, some scientists predict that by 2050, large swathes of the country’s rivers will see a 100%-200% increase in phosphorus and nitrate pollution.
“Water pollution is a one of the biggest problems resulting from ineffective disposal of animal waste,” says Oene Oenema, a professor at Wageningen University, who has spent many years researching agricultural pollution across Asia. “When waste is being disposed of in rivers, and then transported to lakes and coastal zones, fish disappear, the water becomes dark and black, and there’s a high risk of infections being transmitted to humans. In parts of China, there are still discharges directly into service water.”
Some of the most direct health risks posed by increasing amounts of animal waste are likely to come in parts of the world such as Africa, India and much of south-east Asia where communities still live in close contact with their livestock. As these economies grow and become increasingly urbanised in decades to come, the demand for protein will rise sharply, as will the amount of dung.
“This issue will be most acute in places which see massive population increases, such as parts of eastern and southern Asia, and areas of sub-Saharan Africa,” Brown says.
While many sanitation initiatives across sub-Saharan Africa have focused solely on human waste, scientists fear they have overlooked a much greater problem. “There have been a number of studies in low-income countries, where human sanitation for people was improved, but outcomes like diarrhoea didn’t change,” says Jan-Willem Rosenboom, senior programme officer for sanitation and hygiene at the Gates Foundation. “This could be because there’s already so much animal waste in the environment, that merely improving human sanitation doesn’t have enough of an impact on health.”
While centralised farming systems, such as those in Europe and the US, mean that humans avoid direct exposure to animal poo, this is far more commonplace in many low and middle income countries, meaning that enteric infections are still a common cause of death, especially in children. Scientists suspect that many of these deadly infections are zoonotic – which means they can be transmitted directly from animals, or their waste, to humans – and in countries where farmers use high amounts of antibiotics in their livestock, many of these strains may be antibiotic resistant.
“A lot of the animals used in livestock production are reservoirs of zoonotic infections,” Brown says. “So we know, for example, that chickens can transmit salmonella, or hepatitis A, and cows are known to be a source of cryptosporidium exposure. These infections can have long-term outcomes such as malnutrition, anaemia and even cognitive problems.”
Exploiting animal poo to produce environmentally friendly energy through anaerobic digesters requires vast slurry stores to hold the manure, which are prone to either leaking or collapsing. Investigations have found that a store big enough to hold all the waste produced by 100 cows costs UK farmers tens of thousands of pounds, meaning that for many it’s more economically viable to pay a fine for illegally disposing waste than buying a new slurry store.
At the more exotic end of innovation, some companies are convinced they can take waste and turn it into furniture, paper and even clothing.
These are unlikely to make a big difference. A systemic approach to safe management of this waste is going to be needed.

These forests are also the ancestral home of the Koguis, an indigenous group now numbering around 10,000 individuals.
In their cosmology, Koguis are the elders of humanity, living in the heart of the world, while outsiders are the “younger brothers” who were banished because of how they abused the land in the past – an accurate description of a planet where 160,000 acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed or damaged every day.
For centuries, the Koguis have strived to care for their land in a way that will preserve it for future generations. If we listen to them and other indigenous peoples, if we respect their rights and honour their traditions, I think we “younger brothers” still have a chance to get it right.
At the COP 22 climate conference in Marrakesh this week and last, governments are unveiling plans to meet their emission reduction goals – including switching to lower-carbon energy and transport. But it is imperative that these plans also include the vast, sparsely populated areas that are home to indigenous peoples. 
In Latin America, for instance, there are around 40 million indigenous people. Altogether, indigenous and community-owned lands represent around 23% of the region’s total land mass. This is an immense territory, roughly equivalent to the combined surface of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. 
Much of this land is still covered by forests and grasslands whose preservation is a proven and cost-effective way of reducing emissions. In my experience, there is no better way to ensure the careful stewardship of these assets – whether in the Amazon basin, the Andean highlands or the jungles of Central America – than to give indigenous communities full control over the land. 
Indigenous peoples have encyclopaedic knowledge about the landscapes they live in. They also have the strongest possible incentive to ensure the sustainability of those ecosystems. The World Resources Institute conducted a study of 80 forest areas in 10 countries in south Asia, east Africa, and Latin America which found that community-owned and managed forests delivered greater carbon storage, as when local communities have no legal rights, or very few, their forests are more vulnerable to deforestation. Indeed, evidence suggests that strengthening indigenous forest rights is associated with both better communities and healthier forests. 
When local communities have no legal rights, or very few, their forests are more vulnerable to deforestation
In the past, governments and policymakers tended to undervalue the link between climate change mitigation and indigenous land rights. But the Paris Agreement explicitly recognised this, and some governments – including Bolivia and Guatemala – incorporated such considerations into their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 
Of course, land rights are no panacea. Even when they have control, communities need support when deciding how to most effectively use local resources, how to provide a decent livelihood for their people, and how to deal with illegal activities such as clandestine mining and poaching. 
Donor nations and development banks must also help to strengthen the institutions responsible for land tenure and expand climate finance options for investments that promote sustainable landscapes. 
At the Inter-American Development Bank we are seeing a surge in interest from countries to prioritise infrastructure and land use programmes that will contribute to their NDCs. So we are launching a new initiative, NDC Invest, to offer countries a range of support. 

Today, I hope our deeper understanding of the potential impact of indigenous land stewardship will lead to an ambitious inclusion of these communities in the national and global discussions on climate mitigation and adaptation.

While 52% of British people voted to leave the EU, 84% want the ban on hunting foxes to stay, according to the latest Ipsos Mori data. In addition, 88% support the ban on deer-hunting, and 91% back the ban on hunting hares. Support for the ban among people in the countryside is at similar levels.
Ipsos Mori projections indicate that there is a clear majority in favour of the ban in every constituency in England and Wales, including that of all party leaders, and that voters view more favourably those candidates who support the ban by a margin of more than seven to one over those who want it repealed.
We call on all party leaders not only to rule out any repeal, weakening or substitution of the Hunting Act but also to support its strengthening and enforcement.
The Hunting Act is one of the most popular pieces of legislation on the statute book today.

• If there is one issue that should be at the heart of this election, it is climate change. When we next choose a government (in 2022), it’s likely that global temperature will have risen 1.5C. That’s the level that nations (including the UK) pledged at Paris in 2015 should not be breached to avoid dangerous climate change.
At current rates of burning coal, gas and oil, we are on track to put enough carbon in the atmosphere in the next five years to push us past that temperature increase.
But it’s not inevitable. Rapidly increasing our efforts to reduce emissions – from homes, businesses and transport – and installing more renewable energy give us a fighting chance. To build support, politicians must spell out the consequences of not taking the decisive action urgently required on climate change and introduce policies that will drive that action.
Greens have long campaigned for warmer and more efficient homes, renewable energy, public transport, and better provision for cycling – measures that reduce emissions and are cheaper for society in the long term.
I urge voters to find out where the other parties’ candidates stand on climate change and press them to commit to increased action. Because, whatever government we have and however hard or soft Brexit is, the challenge of climate change will still be with us.Robert PalgraveHereford Green party
• There are three reasons the government is reluctant to publish its clean air plan (Report, 28 April). First, it will demonstrate that Defra has prioritised the interests of car manufacturers over the public good for the past five years. Second, the proposals are likely to be deficient and will be heavily criticised pre-election. Third, it will highlight the dangers of Brexit: for without the EU air quality directive, there are no legally binding standards to protect the public from the harmful effects of air pollution.Dr Robin Russell-Jones(Former chair, Campaign for Lead-Free Air), Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire
• Deborah Orr has made the connection between NO2 emissions and hay fever: “The presence of NO2 also triggers allergic reactions to pollen” (Children can’t play if they can’t breathe, 29 April). Increased instances of hay fever, asthma and respiratory problems (especially in urban areas) are an unintended consequence of tree planting programmes, which are done for all the right reasons. But local authority planners and urban designers are not considering allergy and asthma when selecting tree species.
For example: the male catkins of birch may be a delight to see, but they emit copious, almost invisible, airborne pollen, which is a particularly potent trigger of hay fever, asthma and several common food allergies (pollen-food syndrome). The beautiful bark, relatively low purchase and maintenance cost and foliage that is pretty efficient at capturing carbon are positive features, but there are plenty of non-allergenic alternatives that could do the same job of mopping up carbon and releasing oxygen for the benefit of all.
The cost of ignoring allergens is poor respiratory health, days absent from school or work, and individuals suffering due to persistent over-exposure to noxious fumes and particulates and increasingly high pollen counts.
When there are alternatives, the idea of “simply not letting the kids play outside when air pollution is particularly bad” doesn’t really work. Children, when they go to and from school, collect pollen in their airways, hair and clothing, which they then bring home. Neither school nor home is a pollen-free sanctuary. The necessary policies include selecting the right trees and plants for highways and public spaces, alongside actions to cut the NO2 and particulate pollution that is primarily driven by diesel.Jackie HeraldLondon

I want to begin with meeting the Paris targets “in a canter”. Anyone watching politics will know that’s been Morrison’s most consistent talking point, invoked pretty much every day since he took the prime ministership last August.
“In a canter” has always been a head scratcher, because the government’s own data doesn’t bear out the contention. That data shows emissions have been rising since the repeal of the carbon price in 2013.
This week, the government produced a chart setting out the roadmap, a carbon budget if you like, for meeting the Paris target. It quantified the emissions reduction it was factoring in courtesy of its “Climate Solutions Package”.
What this chart makes clear is this: Morrison did not have concrete measures to meet Paris, at least not ones he was prepared to share with the public, until this past week, when he started rolling them out, one by one. Obviously some of the policies have been in gestation for some time, but they only exist when they exist – when they are announced.
This is a small quibble perhaps, this quantifiable gap in Morrison’s timeline, sort of like the prime ministerial equivalent of Afterpay, but it’s been bugging me all week: how you can say last year and early this year that Australia will meet the Paris targets without any qualifications or caveats, and then serve up the plan to get there like it’s an afterthought. Oh, yeah, we’ll need this stuff I guess. To do the cantering.
Now I’ve got that off my chest, a bit more on the proposed abatement measures. I’ve been pointing out since Monday that a big chunk of the abatement the Morrison government is plugging in to its Paris roadmap is not abatement in the way a normal person would consider it, but nifty accounting.
The government is counting a 367-megatonne contribution from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target.
Just for the record, there’s a place for permits and carry-over credits in a national emissions reduction plan in my view – this is a big transformation for a carbon intensive economy like Australia’s to make – but only if accounting practices augment an ambitious program, not substitute for ambition as the hefty carry-over chunk clearly does in the Morrison government plan.
As we are on lame, let’s stick with it. Another big chunk of emissions reduction, almost 100 megatonnes, is booked to “technology improvements”, whatever they might be – and I haven’t yet got to the rebadged emissions reduction fund, which is a mechanism Greg Hunt cooked up in 2009 to make it look like the Coalition was interested in emissions reduction.
Sadly, Greg’s fund has been in place for years, and various projects have been funded, but it hasn’t really done the trick.
How do we know this? The first way we know is emissions are not falling but rising, despite the expenditure of a couple of billions in taxpayer funds on abatement, and the second way we know is my colleague Adam Morton has done some forensic digging, and found the evidence of the fund’s effectiveness is less than compelling.
Greg’s fund, just for people who haven’t followed the intricacies, was concocted just after Malcolm Turnbull was dispatched from the Liberal leadership the first time, in 2009, for alleged green-left heresy. Turnbull, never a big fan of Greg’s fund, tried to do it slowly (as Paul Keating once said in another context) by letting its money run out.
But Malcolm’s efforts to move away from the ERF (and implement something else, the national energy guarantee) ultimately resulted in his colleagues killing Turnbull for a second time in 2018, and then, as fate would have it, reviving Greg’s fund. Deirdre Chambers, what a coincidence. Is Greg’s fund a better electoral asset for the Coalition than Turnbull? I guess we’ll all find out towards the end of May.
Let’s move beyond lame, and rash in terms of electoral calculations, to obvious contradictions. The government this week has backed two major hydro projects – Snowy 2.0 and the “battery of the nation” proposal in Tasmania – and an inconnector that would bring renewable energy from Tasmania to the mainland.
The problem with backing the Marinus Link, which the government has now given $56m to, is that the viability of the project depends (according to the people developing it) on coal leaving the system, and relatively quickly. The feasibility study says the “largest single influencing factor in the economic feasibility and timing of Marinus Link is the trajectory of coal-fired generation retirement in the national electricity market”.
So that creates an inherent contradiction. The government that supports the Marinus Link (to the tune of $56m this week) is the same government that keeps signalling it might either help build new coal projects, or extend the life of existing ones, using the same taxpayer underwriting scheme for power generation that it has indicated it will use to support the “battery of the nation” project.
That means we have a situation where taxpayers are supporting a renewables project that relies on coal retirements to be viable, and then, potentially, also supporting more coal projects – as if, somehow, this is a difference that can be split.
The energy minister, Angus Taylor, during an interview with Sky News this week, declined to say how many coal projects the government was currently looking at for the underwriting scheme. His colleague, the minister for resources, Matt Canavan, supplied the number in a separate interview. He said it was “around 10”.
You really don’t have to penetrate this too far to start to feel like you could be in a Monty Python sketch. If only any of it was funny.
Now speaking of funny, we used to hear quite a lot from the Liberal Craig Kelly, stalwart of the right, and chair of the backbencher committee on energy and environment, during the period when Turnbull was trying to move on from Greg’s fund, and create something else, and also back the Snowy 2.0 project.
Kelly was Eddie Everywhere, like a modern day Hanrahan, predicting imminent ruination. Given the government has now ticked Turnbull’s pet project, and has pushed even deeper into hydro, I wondered whether the oft-predicted ruination was still in prospect, so I gave him a call.
Craig, when we spoke, was entirely tranquil. “I have faith and confidence in the business acumen of Angus Taylor,” he told me.
I asked him why he trusted Taylor more than Turnbull, given the former prime minister seemed to have turned a handsome quid in the private sector. “We’ve discussed this over many months,” Kelly said. “I know how [Taylor’s] mind works.”
I asked Kelly how the government’s attempted climate pivot was going down with his local constituents. He said there had been some electoral pushback, and people were concerned the Coalition had now fallen into bad company, cavorting with renewables instead of coal.
This leads us to the politics of the shift.
The climate reboot is clearly suboptimal in substance, and a bit whacko in places, frankly, but the only thing the government will care about is: will it work? Will Morrison’s climate pivot woo back some of the Coalition’s disgruntled heartland?
The measures unfurled this week are targeted at electorates such as Warringah, and Higgins, and Kooyong, with an overlay of Tasmanian electoral politics. That’s the audience.
But while the government clearly fears the centre of gravity in the climate debate has tilted progressive, and that threatens its re-election chances, it continues to feel the need to tiptoe along a faultline.
Progressive Liberal voters need assurance that the government can do more on climate change than wreck, but there is also a need to keep faith with people who believe coal is good for humanity. This is a dilemma that affects both the major parties to some degree.
While senior government players now feel a sense of frustration that they are being buffeted in a mildly unhinged culture war, this is a culture war the Coalition has helped stoke by consistently frustrating sensible policy, and shovelling overhyped binaries into the national debate for short-term electoral advantage.
If this is a bonfire, it is a bonfire of the Coalition’s own making.
Being pulled in different directions, between different constituencies, explains the major contradictions in the policy, and it explains why the substance of the reboot is flawed, and the delivery is strained.
Will it work? Frankly, I doubt it.

The committee is examining legislation, backed by Labor, the Greens and independents to repeal the cap that prevents more than 1,500 gigalitres of water being bought back from agriculture to assist the environment.
Instead, the government wants the balance of the 2,750-gigalitre target for environmental water to be achieved through efficiency and on-farm projects, in order to avoid what it says will be serious economic impacts of withdrawing water from farms in rural areas.
But under questioning this week, departmental officials said they had not looked into whether it would be more efficient to invest in basic services such as education, health or other activities in affected regions, rather than pour money into “supply and efficiency measures” which include projects such as lining irrigation channels to reduce evaporation.
“It’s a gaping ‘waterhole’ in the government’s due diligence and policy,” said Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick.
Evidence presented to the committee shows that the cost of past river “infrastructure projects” has come in at 2.7 times more per megalitre (returned the river) than simply buying back water entitlements, and could be even higher, depending on accounting methods used.
“On the latest numbers from the Australian government data that’s available, the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers,” Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford school at ANU, told the committee.
The committee heard this week that a study by professorial fellow Glyn Wittwer showed that spending on health, education and basic services produced three to four times more jobs than the same level of expenditure on irrigation infrastructure investment.
Both the Department of Agriculture and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority conceded they had never examined that approach.
The first assistant secretary of the agriculture department’s water division, Paul Morris, said government policy was to “focus on infrastructure”.
“I find this almost unbelievable and most irresponsible,” Patrick said. “The government has a low-risk option that creates more jobs and it’s not taking it. Indeed, it hasn’t even investigated it”.
The difference between buying back water and efficiency projects is looming large in water policy because the next stage of the Murray-Darling basin plan relies much more heavily on efficiency projects to achieve 605GL of water for the environment.
Most of the easier projects have already been implemented, meaning that governments will now have to back more risky and untested projects.
One of these is the Menindee Lakes project put forward by NSW, which aims to save 105GL by reducing evaporation. This involves shrinking the lakes and managing them differently. The project has been heavily criticised for its lack of work on environmental impact, particularly in the wake of the fish kills in the Menindee Lakes area.",502,0.00037593984962406017,0.15075187969924814,0.00037593984962406017,0.30112781954887213,0.4853383458646616,0.007894736842105263,0.00037593984962406017,0.00037593984962406017,0.04548872180451128,0.007894736842105263

It lasted only two years, and was repealed amid much fanfare by the Abbott government in July 2014.
During its time, Australian companies and industries exposed to the carbon pricing mechanism took a long hard look at the emissions liabilities embedded within their supply chains and worked to reduce them.
Barely three years later, Australia is in danger of being the kid that gets picked last for the soccer team. With China set to launch its national emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the end of the year, and several other Asia-Pacific nations either doing the same or already in the game, so-called ‘carbon clubs’ are forming and Australia isn’t invited.
So what will it mean for Australian companies when our biggest trading partner – China – introduces their ETS?
“Our energy-intensive exports sit directly in the supply chain of the world’s largest carbon market, where their customers are going to have a liability around the carbon price,” says Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute. “That will send a market signal of real significance.”
Supply chain emissions – known as Scope 3 emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – refers to those generated outside the direct control of a business. These could be from the extraction and production of products purchased by the business, third-party transport and distribution, and the  end use of its products. 
For many companies, these Scope 3 emissions are likely to be the largest part of their carbon emissions, compared to those generated by the company itself. For example, US company Kraft Foods found its Scope 3 emissions represented more than 90% of its total emissions (pdf).
Supply chain emissions are already being targeted by many multinationals around the world; US retail giant Walmart recently asked its suppliers to help it achieve their goal of removing one gigatonne of carbon dioxide from its Scope 3 supply chain sources by 2030. 
Chinese companies operating under an ETS may well undertake similar initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, which could put Australian companies in that supply chain under pressure.
The recent announcement has added a few more details to the scope of the scheme. 
Chinese government adviser Zhang Xiliang from Tsinghua University told the AFR that it will begin with power generators and expand to encompass eight key sectors by 2020, including steel making and aluminium.
The national scheme was first announced by Chinese president Xi Jinping in September 2015, during a visit by then-US president Barack Obama. At that time, China had been testing the waters since 2013 with pilot schemes in seven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shenzen.
Incorporating power generation into the scheme is another step in China’s ongoing shift to a low carbon energy mix. It also raises further questions over the future of Australia’s coal exports to China, worth $4.2bn in 2015.
“Anyone exporting coal to China needs to be worried; they should simply expect that China will not import coal,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University.
However Tom Luckock, partner in law firm Norton Rose Fulbright’s Beijing office, says China has been moving away from coal-fired power long before the national ETS was announced.
“China has and uses a number of tools to control emissions and it has done so very successfully for a number of years, and in many cases they will have a much larger impact than a carbon market,” Luckock says.
“If you combine an ETS plus this very clear policy in terms of shutting down coal-fired power stations, plus you add in unofficial restrictions on new bank lending for coal fired power stations, plus you add renewables targets for power companies and local officials, together with tax incentives and high tariffs for renewables; all of this will have an impact back in Australia,” he says.
Coal is a small part of the many goods and services that Australia exports to China. That export market, worth $93bn in 2016, includes metals and metal ores – iron, gold, aluminium and zinc, for example – as well as a huge range of other products, from wool and wheat to medicines and machinery parts. 
Elisa de Wit, partner and head of climate change at Norton Rose Fulbright, says any Australian business that deals with China could be affected. 
“Our sense though is that … perhaps there hasn’t been sufficient attention directed towards the impacts for that supply chain arrangement, and particularly for Australian business,” de Wit says. 
The launch of China’s national carbon market could also harm the competitiveness of Australian products. 
Jotzo suggests one effect of the scheme will be to encourage Chinese firms to invest in newer, more efficient production facilities, and pressure out the older, less efficient installations. This could be helped by incentives, like those built into the European Union ETS, which shield domestic industries from competitive disadvantage abroad because of the additional impositions of the carbon pricing mechanisms.
“So once that all works its way through, China will have a more efficient heavy industrial sector as a result of this, and in the longer term will be able to better compete with international competitors,” he says. 
China is not the only nation in the Asia-Pacific region to take steps towards emissions trading schemes. South Korea launched one in 2015, Japan has a cap-and-trade program for Tokyo, New Zealand launched an ETS in 2008, and Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are looking at reducing emissions through a pricing and trading schemes. 
Australia’s lack of a carbon pricing mechanism could see it lag behind in the region, says Castellas, as countries that do have them begin to link their carbon trading markets. 
“When you have Japan, [South] Korea and China having discussions around a north Asian carbon club; when you’ve got China and Korea having discussions around how do we treat emissions across borders and what’s the lowest cost to our economies to meet our emissions targets; when you have China and New Zealand having those conversations about establishing direct engagement because they both have a functioning carbon market with a price; those conversations and those emerging what’s being called ‘carbon clubs’ is something that Australia should be participating in,” he says. 
Jotzo also warns Australia could be more subtly frozen out as a trading partner with China. 
“Quite irrespective of the specific provisions for shielding Chinese industries and all the rest of it, China will then tend to say ‘well hang on …we’re doing the right thing for the global climate, why should we accept imports from countries like Australia or the US where industries are not under any similar obligation’, and that will be an argument in favour of trade restrictions of one form or another,” he says. 
A Chinese national ETS is not all bad news. Despite our lack of a national carbon pricing mechanism, de Wit says Australia still has something to offer countries that implement them. 
“We do see that there’s the potential opportunity for the learnings that have come out of our own offsets market, which has now been in operation for over six years, for some of that expertise to be exported as well into China,” she says. 
It is also possible China might exhaust its domestic carbon offset credits, and Australia could find an opportunity in exporting those to China. 
“It’s an interesting dynamic in terms of thinking about what happens under the Paris agreement, and once the emissions reduction opportunities have been completely extinguished, how you then look at offsetting and where those offsetting opportunities are actually going to come from,” de Wit says. 
One thing is certain: there are more questions than answers about China’s ETS, and the details are eagerly awaited. A spokesperson for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it will be paying close attention to the effects of policy developments on Australian business.
“Once the details of the scheme are made available, we will continue to engage closely with Australian exporters to ensure our advocacy with the Chinese authorities is targeted and appropriate.”",1359,1.5527950310559007e-4,0.416304347826087,0.17096273291925465,0.0032608695652173916,0.21909937888198758,1.5527950310559007e-4,0.17717391304347826,1.5527950310559007e-4,1.5527950310559007e-4,0.012577639751552794

They are trying to agree on the first official release of a report – the bit called the Summary for Policymakers – that pulls together all of what’s known about how the world might be affected once global warming gets to 1.5C.
What will happen to coral reefs? How will extreme weather events and droughts change? What about heatwaves? And then, what are the different “pathways” that economies could choose to keep temperatures to 1.5C?
On Monday morning, the summary document is expected to be released, and there will be a cascade of headlines around the world.
The report, being pulled together by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was one tiny part of the Paris climate change agreement.
As things stand, if you add up all the things that the 190-plus countries have committed to do as part of that Paris deal, global temperatures will probably go well above 3C.
We’re already at 1C of warming, so the extra half a degree isn’t far away – many scientists will say it’s already locked in, while others say there are plausible ways to stabilise temperatures at that level.
But in August, one of the world’s leading scientific journals – the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – published a “perspective” article that has become known as the “hothouse earth” paper.
There was no new science in the paper and while it was speculative, it did raise fundamental questions about the ability of governments around the world to stop the Earth from spiralling into a “hothouse”.
I think the dominant linear, deterministic framework for assessing climate change is flawed
One of the report’s authors, Professor Will Steffen, of Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, talked me through it.
The problem lies with “feedbacks” – in the “supplementary information” attached to the paper, Steffen and colleagues actually listed 10 of them. With each, they include estimates of how much extra CO2 and temperature they could add once you hit about 2C of global warming.
For example, the ability of the land and ocean to keep soaking up CO2 could weaken, giving you an extra 0.25C of warming. Dieback of trees in the Amazon and subarctic could give us another 0.1C.
Permafrost, which is already starting to defy its name by not being all that permanent, could release ever more methane and carbon that might add a bit more warming again (0.09C is the estimate there).
The point is that once you add them all up, you get close to 0.5C of warming by the end of the century. Given we’re already at 1C of global warming, that makes the job of keeping warming “well below 2C” or even holding it at 1.5C much, much harder than it already is.
And there’s the rub.
While governments have the means to affect how much CO2 gets released through policies that radically cut the use of fossil fuels, it would be much harder to get a grip on thawing permafrosts, mass forest collapses or the loss of polar sea ice.
By failing to get a grip on a thing that’s feasibly under your control, we end up risking the release a whole gang of other monsters that we can’t.
This gets us to another big issue, says Steffen, because climate models don’t include some of these feedbacks. In essence, the warmer things get, the less reliable the models become. He tells me:
“I think the dominant linear, deterministic framework for assessing climate change is flawed, especially at higher levels of temperature rise.
So, yes, model projections using models that don’t include these processes indeed become less useful at higher temperature levels. Or, as my co-author John Schellnhuber says, we are making a big mistake when we think we can “park” the Earth System at any given temperature rise – say 2C – and expect it to stay there.”
For those who understand the idea of a carbon budget – where scientists have calculated how much CO2 you could emit before hitting certain temperature rises – it looks even meaner than before if Steffen and his colleagues are right.
But as they also point out, several of these feedbacks might have “tipping points” that then set off a cascade of other issues. Steffen says:
“Even at the current level of warming of about 1C above pre-industrial, we may have already crossed a tipping point for one of the feedback processes (Arctic summer sea ice), and we see instabilities in others – permafrost melting, Amazon forest dieback, boreal forest dieback and weakening of land and ocean physiological carbon sinks.
And we emphasise that these processes are not linear and often have built-in feedback processes that generate tipping point behaviour. For example, for melting permafrost, the chemical process that decomposes the peat generates heat itself, which leads to further melting and so on.”
For the record, Steffen thinks the assumptions in climate models that cuts in fossil fuel emissions will deliver relative cuts in temperatures “is OK for perhaps lower temperature rises of 1.5 or 2C” but beyond that, he’s sceptical.
The paper has received a bit of pushback from scientists, largely, it appears, because of the sensational headlines it attracted.
For example, Professor Richard Betts, of the UK’s MetOffice, has a measured perspective that’s well worth a look.
Dr Glen Peters, an Australian scientist and climate modeller based at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway, also thought some of the media coverage went too far with the doomsday vibe.
But he told me that while it was true that many of the feedbacks in the paper were not well covered by climate models, this was partly because they were not that well understood. I’ll leave you with his thoughts:
“The hothouse earth paper conjectures that many of these feedbacks may interact like a domino effect, lead the Earth system to spiral out of control to reach a new steady state very different from today, and these processes may even start if we are successful at meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.
“There is also an important timescale question, are we talking decades or millennia, and that is very important for how society may respond. While all the claims made in the hothouse earth paper are justified, we simply don’t have the data to verify if those claims are true. While the paper put in plenty of language to indicate its exploratory nature … many headlines and statements went too far, indicating we had already gone too far and there was no turning back.”",1090,0.14535147392290249,0.0024943310657596376,2.2675736961451248e-4,0.05918367346938776,0.0024943310657596376,0.6464852607709751,0.12494331065759638,2.2675736961451248e-4,0.0024943310657596376,0.016099773242630386

Turnbull on Thursday confirmed Australia had ratified the Paris agreement despite domestic opposition from the One Nation party, a critical Senate bloc for the government, and persistent climate change scepticism roiling within Coalition ranks.
After Trump’s victory, and ahead of Turnbull’s confirmation of the government’s intentions with ratification on Thursday morning, the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly said on Facebook the Paris agreement was now “cactus”.
Kelly shared a clip of Trump saying he would cancel the Paris agreement at an oil and gas conference in North Dakota in May.
Kelly subsequently showed little interest in walking back his intervention, taking to Twitter to congratulate the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, for following his social media posts.
Great to know that Bill Shorten follows my Facebook Page
Labor raised the Kelly post in question time on Thursday.
Trump’s victory has emboldened Australian political conservatives, who have used the opportunity to declare local MPs need to push back against so-called “elite” opinion and speak to majority views within the electorate. 
Turnbull attempted during the session to shrug off Kelly’s display of defiance, declaring he was “proud to enter into agreement on behalf of Australia”.
“My government is committed to [the Paris agreement]. We have ratified it,” he said.
Asked earlier in the day by reporters whether Australia would pull out of the agreement if Trump followed through on his threat to pull out, Turnbull noted the US would not be in a position to do anything quickly.
“If a country sought to withdraw from the agreement it takes four years,” the prime minister told reporters on Thursday.
As for Australia’s position, Turnbull emphasised the fact the Paris agreement was a global undertaking and “when Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through, and that is exactly what we are doing”.
The prime minister said the Paris agreement was “a watershed and a turning point” that would deliver international action on climate change.
Australia is the 104th country to ratify the Paris agreement, which came into force earlier this month.
During the routine process of parliamentary review of the agreement, the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts made a submission arguing the government should not ratify the deal.
Roberts told the joint standing committee on treaties the Paris agreement should not enter into force for Australia “on 4 November 2016 or any other date, until both the science and economics have been rigorously and independently assessed and cause and effect is proven”.
“There is no empirical evidence presented anywhere in the world proving carbon dioxide from human activity affects global climate or evidence that its production needs to be cut,” the One Nation senator said. “On this test alone, the treaty must not be ratified.”
The parliamentary inquiry process produced a raft of submissions from a range of groups making the point Australia would struggle to meet its international climate commitments on current domestic policy settings.
Despite the broad-based criticism, the government has repeatedly declined to say whether a review of the Direct Action policy scheduled for 2017 will yield any significant adjustments to the current policy.
Current indications suggest it will be extremely difficult for the government to increase the current level of policy ambition because of internal resistance within the Coalition – which would create consequential problems given Australia has now signed on to the global emissions reduction framework.
The government’s decision to ratify the Paris agreement was welcomed by a range of environment and community groups on Thursday.
“Ratification of the Paris agreement on climate change is a critical aspect of Australia’s commitment to a long term climate and energy strategy that will help promote community and business confidence,” said the deputy chief executive of the climate institute, Erwin Jackson.
Jackson said the timing of the ratification was also important.
“Given the political events in the USA in the last 24 hours, Australia’s ratification also sends a message to the international community about our national intentions,” he said. “This provides us with a level of credibility to be able to join other nations in encouraging other countries, particularly in our region, to implement the agreement as well.”
Kellie Caught, the Australian spokeswoman for WWF-Australia, said ratification meant the government could now move on to the important task of ensuring Australia had a roadmap to lower emissions in line with our international obligations.
“Australia’s ratification means we can now focus on strengthening policies and actions to achieve the agreement’s goals and objectives – in particular the goal of rapid reductions in emissions,” Caught said.
“WWF believes that the Australian government can and must do more to reduce pollution. The current climate targets and policies are not strong enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and protect the people and places we love.”
Oxfam echoed that sentiment. Its climate change spokesman, Simon Bradshaw, said: “Attention must turn to ramping up the Australian government’s contribution to tackling climate change and bringing it closer into line with what the agreement demands.”
“While ratification is a vital step and should be celebrated, the government is yet to do the math on what the agreement means for Australia and the scale of action we must take if we’re to do our part and help avoid a much more dangerous future.”",899,0.00240174672489083,0.006768558951965066,2.183406113537118e-4,2.183406113537118e-4,0.46746724890829694,0.013318777292576418,0.4390829694323144,2.183406113537118e-4,0.07008733624454148,2.183406113537118e-4

A study into temperatures in Brussels and the Pajottenland region south-west of the Belgian capital has raised doubts over the future of the sour lambic beer produced exclusively in the region.
Lambic is fermented in the open air through exposure to wild yeasts and airborne native bacteria. It relies on night-time temperatures of between -8C and 8C (18F-46F) for cooling and inoculation.
The traditional brewing season runs from October to April, with bezomerd – Brussels dialect for a beer that has had “too much summer” – a possibility if it is produced any later.
After cooling, the lambic is placed in wooden barrels where it is exposed to microbes living on the wood. The perfect temperature for ageing lambic is below 25C, above which the risk of unwelcome bacteria spoiling the beer rises.
A joint project between the climate scientists Mark and Asa Stone, Adam Harbaugh from the beer research site Lambic.info and the Brussels brewery Cantillon found this limited brewing window has shortened from 165 days in the early 1900s to about 140, as temperatures have pushed it later into the autumn and brought the season prematurely to an end in early spring.
It is feared the number of brewing days will shrink further, bringing the risk of a similar disaster to 2015, when beer had to be thrown away due to excessive temperatures.
Dr Mark Stone, a director at the University of New Mexico’s Resilience Institute, said: “The impacts of climate change are often gradual until a tipping point is crossed. Our results show that Cantillon is experiencing shifting brewing conditions, and that adaptation to avoid crossing a threshold will require changes in brewing operations that are outside of their traditional methods.
“The threat of climate change on traditional lambic production at Cantillon is indicative of the broader issue. That is, the impacts are not fully recognised until a threshold has been crossed, and adaptation strategies often exacerbate the problem while delaying the inevitable.”
Cantillon, which produces 400,000 bottles of the sour beer a year, has warned its ability to produce the beer could be under threat in the long term.
Jean Van Roy, Cantillon’s owner, told the Brussels Beer City blog that he believed if he artificially cooled the wort – a liquid extracted during the mashing process – it would change the taste of the beer.
“If tomorrow I would have this problem every season, financially it could be a bit difficult, so we would have to change something,” he said.

The two energy sources I am most interested in are wind and solar power; however, there are other sources that have great potential.
Some people doubt how much wind and solar can supply to a country’s electricity grid. This is a particularly challenging question to answer in part because both solar power and wind power fluctuate in both space and time. We all know solar panels work well during the day, when the sun shines – they don’t work so well at night. And wind turbines only send electrons when the wind is blowing. 
Fortunately, these two sources of energy fluctuate in ways that complement each other. For instance, solar power generation is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Wind power is greatest in the spring and fall. Wind turbines work at night when solar panels are dormant. So, can these complementing variations help balance out the power that the two technologies can provide? 
This question was addressed in a very recent paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. The author list included Dr. Ken Caldeira, who is extremely well known for his years of work in environmental science and energy.
The authors analyzed 36 years of hourly weather data (1980–2015) in the US. They calculated the available wind and solar power over this time period and also included the electrical demand in the US and its variation throughout the year.
With this information, the researchers considered two scenarios. In scenario 1, they imagined wind and solar installations that would be sufficient to supply 100% of the US electrical needs. In the second scenario, the installations would be over-designed; capable of providing 150% of the total U.S. electrical need. But the authors recognize that just because a solar panel or a wind turbine can provide all our energy, it doesn’t mean that will happen in reality. It goes back to the prior discussion that sometimes the wind just doesn’t blow, and sometimes the sun isn’t shining.
With these two scenarios, the authors then considered different mixes of power, from all solar to all wind. They also included the effect of aggregation area, that is, what sized regions are used to generate power. Is your power coming from wind and solar in your neighborhood, your city, your state or your region?
The authors found that with 100% power capacity and no mechanism to store energy, a wind-heavy portfolio is best (about 75% wind, 25% solar) and using large aggregate regions is optimal. It is possible to supply about 75-80% of US electrical needs. If the system were designed with excess capacity (the 150% case), the US could meet about 90% of its needs with wind and solar power.
The authors recognized that sometimes these systems generate too much power to be used. Under this situation, you could store the energy for later use. Imagine a solar panel generating excess energy during the day and able to store that power for night use. Power can be stored in several ways, for example in batteries or by pumping water into elevated tanks and then letting the water fall at night and turn a turbine. 
The authors modified their study to allow up to 12 hours of US energy storage. They then found that the 100% capacity system fared even better (about 90% of the country’s energy) and the optimal balance was now more solar (approximately 70% solar and 30% wind). For the over-capacity system, the authors found that virtually all the country’s power needs could be met with wind, solar, and storage.
This study considered only wind and solar. If other sources, such as hydroelectricity, biofuels, or even nuclear power were added, it would be relatively straightforward to reach 100% clean energy. Furthermore, people are learning to use energy more wisely, either by using more efficient products or purchasing electricity during off-peak hours. These behavioral changes can also help us reach a 100% clean energy target.
The point is, the use of clean energy to power an entire country (or a group of countries) is achievable. It’s no longer viable to say “we can’t.”",697,0.08419354838709678,0.7132258064516129,3.225806451612903e-4,3.225806451612903e-4,3.225806451612903e-4,0.15516129032258064,3.225806451612903e-4,3.225806451612903e-4,3.225806451612903e-4,0.04548387096774193

As the primary election season turns toward a head-to-head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there is increasing anger and frustration over the nature of the contest. A Guardian call-out to online readers in the US asking them to reflect on the race so far was met by a barrage of criticism on the tone and substance of the world’s most important election – with the two main parties, individual candidates and the media all coming under heavy fire.
The Guardian asked readers to identify the “one issue that affects your life you wish the presidential candidates were discussing more”. Resoundingly, the largest group of participants pointed to climate change.
Of the 1,385 who responded to the call-out – from all 50 states – one in five expressed discontent at the relative silence from candidates around a subject that they believed to be of supreme and epochal importance. They noted that much of the Republican debate has either focused on blatant denial that climate change even exists or on how to unpick Barack Obama’s attempts to fight global warming, while on the Democratic side both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have raised the issue but have rarely pushed it to the top of the political agenda.
Many of the respondents vented despair at a political system that in their view allowed a matter of such overwhelming significance to be so overlooked. “The fact that no one is really talking about climate change, to me, is indicative of just how lost we are,” said Linda Hayden, 51, from Oregon. “Our house is on fire and we are arguing about who is more angry!”
Vivid words and phrases were used to articulate the scale of the pending disaster that readers accused the presidential hopefuls of ignoring, such as “cataclysmic”, “running out of time”, “threat to human life”, “path towards destruction”, or in one particularly memorable remark: “slow-motion apocalypse”.
A reader from Alaska, a state acutely feeling the impact of climate change, used the word “Doomed!”, while an 18-year-old woman from Tennessee who asked to remain anonymous simply said: “Freaking global climate change.” Jennie Ratcliffe, 66, from North Carolina quibbled with the Guardian’s wording of the question, saying “this is far more than an ‘issue’ – it’s a crisis”.
“I’m a climate scientist, and almost no one in the general public knows just how serious and urgent this really is,” said Peter Kalmus, 41, from Altadena, California. “Not only is it real – it’s terrifying.”
The concerns of voters came to light as part of the Guardian’s Voices of America series which aims to highlight the way key issues have been ignored or under-played during a primary season when trivial personal attacks seemed to take precedence over substantial debate of issues that matter.
The Guardian call-out was not a poll, and as such was not a controlled survey of opinion. But it does illuminate a largely hidden depth of concern, particularly among liberal Americans, about a gathering global disaster that has tended to be discussed, if at all, at the fringes of the presidential debate.
Most of the respondents were liberal-leaning. About 80% said they planned to support a Democratic candidate – by comparison, around 31% of Americans overall describe themselves as Democrat (a higher 49% if you include those who say they are “Democrat-leaning”).
That disparity is likely to have influenced the fact that climate change was top of the pile of priorities for those who participated – only 19 of the 284 respondents who mentioned climate change said they were unaffiliated to a party and just two described themselves as Republican.
This ideological gap also plays out in public opinion research which uses a nationally representative sample of respondents. Last year, Pew Research Center found that 76% of liberal Democrats said that “global warming is a very serious problem” compared to 14% of conservative Republicans.
That is perhaps a reflection of a fundamental disagreement among Americans about the reasons for, and even existence of, climate change. Pew found that 64% of Democrats believed global warming was caused by human activity while only 22% of Republicans agreed.
Participants in the Guardian project reserved their greatest ire for those Republican candidates who have expressed skepticism on the campaign trail that human-induced climate change exists at all. Among prominent GOP contenders, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio all cast doubt while they were running on climate change science while Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul argued against the need for urgent action to tackle the problem.
The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has said he is “not a great believer” in man-made climate change, suggesting it is a hoax put about by the Chinese. When he set out his energy plan, he promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement that commits countries to reduce levels of polluting emissions.
Anthony Friedline, 31, of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was one of many respondents who expressed frustration at how the subject had been treated during the presidential TV debates: “One party thinks it is a hoax, and on the other side no one wants to discuss it except Bernie Sanders who the media doesn’t want to give the time of day because he isn’t part of the ‘establishment’. Who cares about ‘establishment politics’ when the fate of the whole damn planet is in our hands and we, apparently, are going to do nothing to fix it?”
Forest Menke-Thielman, 32, from Oregon, wrote that “the Republicans still haven’t admitted climate change exists, but even Democrats are not making it a priority like they should. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have mentioned it, but are not prioritizing it enough. All the candidates act as if this isn’t happening, and everyone knows that it is. Let’s get real folks!”
The strikingly bleak view of so many American voters towards the presidential election process chimes with the dismay of prominent environmental groups and campaigners who had hoped that the race for the most powerful job on earth would become a channel for serious discussion about how to tackle climate change. 
Michael Brune, executive director of the 2.4 million-strong Sierra Club, America’s largest environmental movement, said: “Our members are in shock right now about Donald Trump – they are asking how we got to this point and what must be done to stop him becoming president.”
Brune added: “We feel it’s unconscionable that the overwhelming coverage has focused on the size of Trump’s hands or how he belittles his opponents, as opposed to how our civilization will be powered and climate change averted.”
The climatologist Michael Mann, who is director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said he did believe that Clinton and Sanders had engaged in meaningful dialogue about climate change, and pointed the finger of blame at the media for failing fully to reflect that. He added that as the general election gets underway he hoped there would be more focus on “substantive and critical differences in the views of the candidates, and less focus on frivolous and prurient matters that serve as little more than distraction and misdirection”.
 Mann said: “The American people could not have a starker choice before them between a presumptive candidate of one of the two parties who recognizes the risk posted by human-caused climate change and articulates solutions, and the presumptive candidate of the other party, who denies that climate change is even real.”
 The co-founder of the climate campaign 350.org, Bill McKibben, who Sanders has appointed to the platform committee at the upcoming Democratic national convention, struck a positive note by pointing out that in the 2012 presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, climate change was not raised at all until just days before the election as a result of Hurricane Sandy. “This time around, whoever the Democrat is will be hammering Trump and the rest of the GOP for their blindness to climate science – it’s now a losing proposition for them. So, scientists and movements have done their job in that way.”
 But he went on to warn that “merely believing in climate change at this point is way too low a bar. We need leaders who understand it’s the issue of our century, and will work with the focus it requires.”
Climate change was the most prominent among a host of different political concerns that respondents to the call-out complained were being insufficiently aired during the election. Accounting for one in 10 responses, the next most common group of worries related to tax reform, income inequality and poverty . Similarly high were mentions of campaign finance and corruption in politics, those too made up around one in ten responses.
Insecurity was a theme in many of the responses – 8% of respondents said they wanted leaders to focus on foreign policy while 7% said job security.
Most of our respondents skewed towards the Democratic party. Amongst those who were explicit, 577 said they were Bernie Sanders supporters while just 53 said they were voting for Hillary Clinton. A further 81 respondents saying they would vote for Trump.

His administration had tried to hide the report, publishing it on Black Friday when many Americans were either recovering from a Thanksgiving food coma or stampeding department store sales.
The administration’s plan backfired badly – the latest alarming climate science report became front-page news. Numerous Republican politicians were asked about it on TV news and politics shows, and their answers demonstrated that Trump’s climate science denial continues to pervade the GOP.
Republican party leaders’ answers ranged from platitudes – such as “our climate always changes” and “innovation” is all that is needed to solve the problem – to accusations that “a lot of these scientists are driven by the money”.
Addressing the latter point,one of the report’s lead authors, Prof Katharine Hayhoe, noted that many of its contributors were “paid zero dollars” and estimated that in the time she devoted to the assessment, she could have written eight of her own papers. Conversely, GOP politicians and operatives are paid millions of dollars annually by the fossil fuel industry. Some people are clearly driven by the money, and it’s not climate scientists.
Trump’s comments did not stop at disbelief – he also appeared to shift blame to other countries and tout the US’s clean air and water.
“You’re going to have to have China, and Japan, and all of Asia, and all of these other countries – you know, [the report] addresses our country. Right now, we’re at the cleanest we’ve ever been, and that’s very important to me. But if we’re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that’s not so good. So, I want clean air, I want clean water – very important,” the president said.

These comments confuse climate change with air pollution, but the two are connected. The national climate assessment report pointed out that climate change was exacerbating wildfires, which in turn create air pollution. The Camp fire in November produced so much smoke that California had the worst air quality in the world at the time.
A key figure showed that climate change had approximately doubled the area burned by wildfires in the western US, and the report noted that – contrary to the administration’s frequent claims – this increase was “more closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors”.
Trump’s claim that US air is “the cleanest it’s ever been” is also not strictly true. Despite a long-term downward trend, owing in large part to the replacement of coal power plants that the Trump administration is desperately trying to save, particulate matter levels were up slightly from 2016 to 2017.
The administration’s efforts to weaken and repeal every possible environmental regulation certainly do not merit credit for the long-term improvement in air and water quality in the US.
Trump’s efforts to shift blame to other countries is also at odds with the fact that every other nation in the world has signed up to the Paris climate accords and only one government has announced its intent to withdraw from them.
The Republican party has become Trump’s as well. The few party leaders who were willing to acknowledge the threats detailed in the report claimed that all the climate policies proposed thus far would be harmful to the economy, and that we should instead focus on innovation.
While individual climate policies may or may not slow the economy, the scientific research is clear that climate change will curb economic growth – particularly in the US. The assessment report makes clear that if we’re worried about the economy, we must slow global warming. And while research into potential carbon-cutting technology innovations is needed, hoping that somebody will invent a way out of this mess is too big a risk. It is accepted that solving global warming won’t be cheap or easy but failing to do so will come at a much higher cost and not just in terms of money.
Those were the least irrational of the Republican party’s reactions to the report, as most of the five stages of climate denial were on display. One conservative panelist went as far as to claim: “We had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years.”
In reality, at the end of this year, 2014–2018 will be the five hottest years ever recorded. And virtually everything Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said about the report was wrong, including that it was “not based on facts … not data-driven”.
As the US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said: “The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.”

It’s exciting stuff. We think solar could power 20% of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool, as well as 15% of commuter routes in Kent, Sussex and Wessex. There’s scope for solar trams in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Manchester too, and there’s no reason it should just be a British thing either. We’re especially excited about possibilities in San Francisco, Mexico City, India and Spain, but trains and trams all over the world could be running on sun in a few years time.
It’s also a genuine world first. There are a few solar stations – Blackfriars Bridge being by far the coolest – and some trains in India even have solar panels on their roofs, but that’s just to power equipment like lights and fans. No one’s moving the trains themselves with solar. Yet.
What’s especially interesting is how our new innovation came about – in particular the role community energy groups have played in its development (often despite policy support, not because of it, or in response to policy constraints). Looking ahead, there are also important questions to be asked about what role these community groups might play in its deployment.
 The idea came from a community solar group in Balcombe, West Sussex, formed in response to the first anti-fracking protests in the UK, in the summer of 2013. After the drillers, the activists, the press and various other hangers-on had left, the villagers were left with a question our current energy system lets most of us ignore: how should we power ourselves?
They decided they wanted local, community-owned energy, and also that they wanted to go solar. Looking into places to site a solar farm, they initially found the local grid didn’t have the capacity to take more solar. Searching for a way to solve that problem, they looked at the local railway and asked an engineering professor who happened to live locally, “could we plug it there, instead?” His answer was yes, they could, but the technical challenges to get there were a bit too much for a small-scale community group to grapple with. So they found another nearby solar site that could plug into the grid.
But when solar cuts hit the UK in 2015, we dug out the idea. What had been a possible local solution to Balcombe’s grid capacity issues a while back could build into a larger opportunity for renewable energy everywhere. Community energy shouldn’t have had to innovate at that point – renewable energy tech’s pretty great as it is – but with the solar cuts so deep, and onshore wind effectively banned in England, the solar trains idea gave us options. So 10:10 teamed up Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London, umbrella group Community Energy South, and electrical engineering specialists Turbo Power Systems to find out more under Innovate UK’s Energy Game Changers competition.
Looking ahead, it will be a few years yet before we’re able to deploy the tech necessary to plug solar into trains. It needs building, and it needs testing, but I’d be shocked if it doesn’t happen. What’s less clear is whether community groups will be involved as solar railways roll out. As they’ve been part of this from the get-go, they’re super-keen. But it’s all too easy for the public to be shunted to the sidelines when the big budgets and complexity of infrastructure projects get going.
It’s common for public involvement to be seen as an inefficiency – in science, politics, finance, technology and more – a “nice to have” that takes too much time and effort when we’re in the serious business of things like climate change, economics and keeping the trains running on time.
But the opposite is true, especially when it comes to climate action. It’s the public who are driving change, often despite the actions of policy-makers.
Community energy offers a particularly powerful way to give members of the public a role in decarbonisation. Moreover, by tapping into their energy, enthusiasm and ability to bring other members of the public with them, we’ll get it done faster, as well as fairer. If it wasn’t for community energy groups coming up with this idea, pushing it forward and scoping out the places it could be utilised, solar trains would still be far more than a few years away.

It is not numbers of people per se damaging the planet, but frenetic consumption in the wealthy world that lies behind anthropogenic climate change. You can curb family sizes in poor countries all you like – if you have the moral stomach for such gross colonialism and denial of essential human freedoms – but the ecological crisis will remain as long as we live the way we do in the rich world.
As Pope Francis puts it in his ecological teaching document, Laudato Si’: “To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.”
He does not, however, deny population is a factor in the environment, noting that “attention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations”. But the general point is clear: you do not heal the damage to the planet by eliminating the poor. As Francis says: “a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.”Dr Austen IvereighCoordinator, Catholic Voices
• While I am enthused by Pope Francis’s recent calls for environmental destruction to be classified as a sin (Report, 1 September), I do wonder if a more nuanced perspective is required. Is it right to classify certain behaviours that cause ecological harm as sin, if there is a lack of knowledge, capacity and choice to take alternative, more environmentally friendly courses of action?
For example, is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to drive my gas-guzzling car in the city because of an absence of safe and coordinated cycle infrastructure? Is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to deal with the vast amounts of waste forced upon me by retailers? Or if I depend on oil because alternatives are not provided, or are too expensive?

Heatwaves are affecting many more vulnerable people and global warming is boosting the transmission of deadly diseases such as dengue fever, the world’s most rapidly spreading disease. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning is also causing millions of early deaths each year, while damage to crops from extreme weather threatens hunger for millions of children.
The findings, published in the Lancet journal, come from researchers at 26 institutions around the world, including many universities, the World Health Organization, World Bank and the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO reported on Monday that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made a record jump in 2016 to hit a concentration not seen for more than three million years.
“Climate change is happening and it’s a health issue today for millions worldwide,” said Prof Anthony Costello, at the World Health Organization and co-chair of the group behind the new report. It follows a related report in 2009 that warned that climate change was the biggest danger to global health in the 21st century, an assessment repeated in the new report.
But Costello said acting to halt global warming would also deliver a huge benefit for health: “The outlook is challenging, but we still have an opportunity to turn a looming medical emergency into the most significant advance for public health this century.”
“Our scientists have been telling us for some time that we’ve got a bad case of climate change. Now our doctors are telling us it’s bad for our health,” said Christiana Figueres, who as the UN’s climate chief negotiated the Paris climate change agreement and also co-chaired the new report. 
“Hundreds of millions of people are already suffering health impacts as a result of climate change,” she told the Guardian. “Tackling climate change directly, unequivocally, and immediately improves global health. It’s as simple as that.”
One of the most striking of the 40 indicators assessed by the researchers was a huge increase in the number of people over 65 exposed to extreme heat. This rose by 125 million between 2000 and 2016 and worries doctors because older people are especially vulnerable to heat.
“There is no crystal ball gazing here, these are the actual observations,” said Prof Peter Cox, at the University of Exeter, UK. He said the 70,000 deaths that resulted from the 2003 heatwave in Europe looked small compared to the long-term trends: “We were alarmed when we saw this.” 
Most of the increase in exposed people resulted from rising temperatures, but the number of older people is also rising, creating a “perfect storm”, Cox said. The report also found that hotter and more humid weather was increasingly creating conditions in which it is impossible to work outside. In 2016, this caused work equivalent to almost a million people to be lost, half in India alone.
The report also found that climate change has increased the ability of dengue fever to spread, because the mosquitoes and the virus they carry breed more quickly. Dengue is also known as “breakbone fever” due to the pain it causes and infections have doubled in each decade since 1990, now reaching up to 100m infections a year now. Dengue was used as an example in the report and the researchers suggest global warming will also increase the spread of other diseases such as schistosomiasis.
Air pollution is known to cause millions of early deaths every year but the new report highlights the 800,000 annual deaths related solely to coal burning. The good news here, said Prof Paul Wilkinson, is that coal production peaked in 2013 and is now falling. “We are seeing the first turn [in the trend] but we have a long way to go,” he said. “It is a health dividend we are ignoring if we do not act.” 
The impacts of climate change are not limited to poorer nations, said Dr Toby Hillman, at the Royal College of Physicians, but also affect developed nations like the UK. He said air pollution kills about 40,000 in the UK each year and criticised low government funding levels for cycling and walking. Hillman also noted other impacts, such as sharp increases in mental health problems after extreme weather events like flooding.
The new report highlighted imminent threats as well, such as the loss of crops to increasingly hot and extreme weather. “We are going to see millions more undernourished children as a result of that,” said Prof Hugh Montgomery, at University College London (UCL). 
Montgomery said the potential benefits of climate change appeared to be small in comparison to the damages: “We are not ducking the potential benefits, we just find it hard to see what they are.”
Cox said it was not clear that global warming will actually reduce winter cold spells, which cause early deaths in higher latitude countries, because changes happening in the Arctic can exacerbate cold snaps. Prof Georgina Mace, also at UCL, said the evidence for a warmer climate increasing food production was often very localised and short term: ”Overall the overwhelming pattern is negative.”
Clare Goodess, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia and not part of the Lancet report, said: “The indicators reveal some stark warnings for human health, as well as some glimmers of hope, [and] the key messages appear robust. The attribution of [climate change] temperature trends to human activities is now unequivocal, so the urgency of addressing the issues raised by this report is not in doubt.”",920,0.3234883720930232,0.011860465116279069,2.3255813953488373e-4,0.06767441860465116,2.3255813953488373e-4,0.2932558139534884,0.2397674418604651,0.032790697674418605,2.3255813953488373e-4,0.030465116279069768

The 740,000 sq km Rapa Nui marine park is roughly the size of the Chilean mainland and will protect at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.
An astonishing 77% of the Pacific Ocean’s fish abundance occurs here and recent expeditions discovered several new species previously unknown to science.
Apex predators found in the conservation zone include scalloped hammerhead sharks, minke, humpback and blue whales, and four species of sea turtle.
Matt Rand, the director of the Pew Bertarelli ocean legacy project, which campaigned for the park, said: “This marine reserve will have a huge global significance for the conservation of oceans and of indigenous people’s ways of life.
“The Rapa Nui have long suffered from the loss of timber, declining ecosystems and declining populations. Now they are experiencing a resurgence based on ensuring the health of the oceans.”
Plans for the marine park were first announced at a conference in 2015, at which the former US president Barack Obama declared his “special love for the ocean” in a video message. 
The plans were confirmed in a speech by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet on Saturday.
The marine park’s creation was enabled by a 73% vote in favour of the conservation zone from Easter Island’s 3,000 Rapa Nui population in a referendum on 3 September, after five years of consultations.
Extractive industries and industrial fishing will be banned inside the reserve, but the Rapa Nui will be allowed to continue their traditional artisanal fishing on small boats, using hand lines with rocks for weights.
Ludovic Burns Tuki, the director of the Mesa del mar coalition of more than 20 Rapa Nui groups, said: “This is a historic moment – a great and beautiful moment for the Rapa Nui, for the world and for our oceans.
“We think this process can be an example for the creation of other marine reserves that we need to protect our oceans – with a respect for the human dimension.”
After the creation of a comparable marine protection area around the nearby Pitcairn Islands last year, proposals for a reserve in the Austral Islands’ waters could soon create a protected area of more than 2m sq km. This would have a unifying potential for the Polynesian people, according to Burns Tuki.
“The ocean is very important to us as a source of food, but the Polynesians were great navigators and the ocean also represents our mother,” he said. “It enables us to move with a double canoe between the different islands. It gives us everything.”
As global warming takes hold, some scientific papers suggest that marine reserves may also help mitigate climate change and provide a vital carbon sink. The deep, clear and cool waters around Easter Island are also a resilient area for coral reefs. 
Marcelo Mena, Chile’s environment minister, said: “This marine protected area adds to the legacy of President Bachelet and the 1.5m sq km of protected areas created by this government.”
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has called for 30% of the world’s oceans to be protected, but only about 1.6% has so far been covered by marine protection areas.",526,3.6496350364963507e-4,3.6496350364963507e-4,3.6496350364963507e-4,0.712043795620438,3.6496350364963507e-4,0.04781021897810219,0.0843065693430657,0.0989051094890511,0.05145985401459854,0.0040145985401459855

Now we will have to deal with climate change | Jason Wilson,The baby boomers gave us Trump and Brexit. Can my generation age more gracefully?,"Generational politics is bullshit, but a Gen X guy would say that. I sometimes wonder, though, whether whatever is distinctive in my generation’s experience (and haunting our minds) might have something to offer the future.
After a brief flurry of interest in the 1990s, thinkpieces on my demographic quickly waned. There were never that many of us; the meat in the sandwich was and is meagre.
Tired of their younger cousins and brothers, around the turn of the century, boomer pundits pivoted to an obsession with their millennial children. Those children stared back at them with mostly well-founded resentment. Both sides continue to have this out, ad nauseam.
This oedipal struggle has tended to crowd us out; as the New Yorker writer Emily Nussbaum pointed out, Generation X is now sometimes forgotten altogether in articles pondering generational difference. In a tweet Nussbaum called our generation “gloomy, curmudgeonly ghosts”. By trying to relieve the gloom with a self-deprecating wisecrack, she exemplified another generational tic.
The flipside of the irony and gloom that characterised Gen X culture may be a kind of pragmatic resilience
This relative invisibility has had many consequences. One is that, while the economic plight of millennials has been considered at length, the difficulties of Generation X, which in some ways paralleled or even prefigured them, have received less attention.
My sliver of Generation X (I’m 45) exited high school into the early 1990s recession. The oldest Xers did the same a decade earlier. On the way to Brisbane for university back then, I remember that each provincial Queensland town I passed through looked like a bomb had hit it. After a brief moment where the same towns were full of jet skis and new utes, post-boom, post-flood, many have now returned to their former state.
This was formative: I for one never expected to find a real job. (Outside a few brief stretches, this expectation has been met).
Although Generation X were the last to taste the fruits of postwar, middle-class stability in advanced economies, they were also the first to see major elements of it snatched away – especially in Australia.
In Australia, after 1989, we didn’t receive a free higher education as many baby boomers did (I still have student debt). We were the first whose adult lives unfolded entirely under the cold skies of a “reformed” neoliberal economy, with weakened worker power and radically diminished job security (not to mention social security). We were the first not to exceed their parents in terms of many markers of wealth and success.
We have also had to wait longest for the boomers to leave the stage. Way back in 1997, Mark Davis’s Gangland spelled out the stranglehold that baby boomers retained on Australian cultural life. Sadly, while the book expressed the feelings of a generation, it didn’t change much. Even now, many of the commanding heights of the culture are still in the possession of a generation that refuses to retire, despite Gen Xers entering what would ordinarily be understood as their late career.
As was pointed out in a recent episode of US-based The Nostalgia Trap podcast, those early economic travails may be what gives so much of the youth culture of the 1990s – the only decade that Generation X can really call its own – a distinctive, depressive quality.
Grunge – both the Seattle-born musical genre and the short-lived Australian literary movement – aestheticised the conditions of unemployed dirtbaggery that the 1990s forced upon us.
Praise, the ur-grunge-lit novel by recently deceased Brisbane writer Andrew McGahan, blankly told the story of Gordon, a man who lives in a boarding house, and drifted drunk and aimless through his life. Gordon can’t be described as a failure because there’s little indication that he’s really trying.
To the extent that Generation X received much attention, it was during this period: the time when we — and our designated generational representatives — were declaring ourselves creeps, losers, slackers. It may have displaced analysis away from the structural causes of our failure to economically thrive, but there are worse coping strategies.
Other more militant expressions of disenfranchisement that were not simply generational appeared in hip-hop. NWA’s records anticipated the grimness of much of the alt-rock boom but transmitted the devastated post-Reagan social landscape of the United States much more vividly. Hip-hop was also more specifically targeted for censorship in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. During the 1990s Australia’s pop culture institutions, such as Triple J mostly shut out hip-hop altogether.
The achievement in all of this cultural expression was to take seriously the idea that there may be no golden future. Some of it questioned the idea that there may be any future at all.
Unfortunately (for some of us at least) a future has after all arrived. According to most definitions that offer precise generational boundaries, Generation X are those born between the mid-1960s and the late 1970s. (Boomers and millennials even get to inhabit larger slices of time, with two decades apiece).
This means that, as of 2019, the entire generational cohort has entered the broadly recognised parameters of middle age; the oldest Gen-Xers are now in their mid-50s, and some now eligible to cash in whatever superannuation they might have managed to accumulate.
The next stop is old age. What will we do with it? Many boomers have failed the test of ageing gracefully. That generation’s youth has endlessly been replayed to the rest of us as a moment of near-revolutionary exuberance (in his book Generation X, Douglas Coupland identified the mandatory veneration of the 1960s as “legislated nostalgia”).
But now, some boomers have hardened; too many are shouty Facebook uncles or Nimby aunts. Not all boomers are reactionary, or economically privileged, of course. But disproportionately it is boomers – especially white boomers – who elected their generational counterpart Donald Trump president of the United States. Also, boomers disproportionately voted in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
Given its more cramped and gloomy formative years, can Generation X age more gracefully? Once again, the answer may come in the midst of circumstances we would not have chosen, given the chance. The tests ahead are sterner than those that any generation has faced in some time.
Generation X will grow to old age in a world which (it seems inevitable now) will be ravaged by the effects of climate change. We may be the last to grow old in anything resembling a stable form of modern civilisation.
The stresses currently warping politics in liberal democracies are set to become worse. There will be more refugees as a result of climate change, and the refugee crisis may hit even closer to home: parts of Australia and the American south-west will be effectively uninhabitable. Some places are almost there already.
Our economies are likely to be irreparably damaged as cities and towns are repeatedly pounded by storms, wildfires and floods. We may not be able to grow enough food — we may even have trouble pollinating some food plants due to the decline of insects.
As resource constraints increase, so will conflicts over them. Wars of all kinds – civil, global – will be more likely in a world turning upside down. A new book by David Wallace-Wells, The Uninhabitable Earth, spells out all of the likely consequences in detail.
The boomers can take comfort in the fact that most of them will be dead before the worst of this arrives from the middle of the century. Generation X will likely face dire crises in what may otherwise have been its golden years. Those of us with children have even more to worry about. When we understood, early, that we may not do as well as our parents did, we didn’t know the half of it.
To the extent that the world looks to the old for wisdom, we will be in the hot seat. What will we do? What advice can we give? We may be better prepared for it than we imagine.
For one, some of us have been hearing about climate change since we were schoolchildren. We are far less likely to deny the realities of what is happening than our predecessors. (Research in the US suggests an age gap on climate change – only 31% of 65+ Americans in 2015 believed it was happening due to human activity, whereas majorities did in all age groups under 50).
So we may be more prepared to recommend or support radical solutions in a way that our complacent elders have not.
We also have a radical political history of our own, which the culture has not memorialised, which too many of us have forgotten, and which we may be able to draw on.
In 1992, LA erupted in response to police violence. Throughout the 1990s, the pioneers of third-wave and intersectional feminism challenged all expressions of misogyny, patriarchy and homophobia.
If the boomers had the abortive revolution of 1968, we had 1999 and 2000. In Seattle, at Woomera and in Melbourne, an anti-authoritarian, leftwing protest politics was enacted which was unconnected to authoritarian state socialism, and had nothing to do with the cold war. On its own terms, much of it found short-term success – the police were outwitted in the Battle of Seattle by technology-enhanced protesters; the Woomera protests contributed to the centre’s closure, although the policy of immigration detention remains in place and is harsher than ever.
This protest wave was interrupted by 9/11, the so-called war on terror, and the subsequent ramping up of security states around the world.
There will be plenty of authoritarian solutions preferred for what’s coming down the pike. Eco-fascism is on the march; its solution to the climate crisis is genocide. “Normal” conservatives will seek to build walls and detain or refoul the desperate, and if recent history is any guide, the centre-left will dutifully maintain them. The radical left, too, has succumbed to the temptation of authoritarianism in the past in the face of perceived disorder and subversion.
As the last who remember the cold war, who were adults as the war on terrorism began, it is up to us to remind people why they must resist such solutions. It is up to us to preserve, as long as we can, the memory of what flourished in the gaps during the 1990s as the world transitioned from one system to another.
The flipside of the irony and gloom that characterised Generation X culture may be, if we can maintain it, a kind of pragmatic resilience. We have survived. Any future that may be left to us is a bonus. We were never really in charge anyway, so let’s keep rolling with the punches.
Most importantly we must, as we age, know when to exhibit what may be our best trait, and a skill that the boomers never mastered. We must remember when to fade into the background, when to let others say their piece. We should endeavour to become, where circumstances require it, like ghosts.

Oliver Milman runs down today’s best climate innovations,"People in the US and beyond concerned about climate change may be alarmed at the Trump administration’s policies and attitudes – but there are plenty of businesses and innovators doing work at various scales. 
From solar to fake meat and low-carbon concrete, Oliver Milman explores some of the best examples of climate change-tackling innovations and innovators.
 Large-scale solar is a booming industry in the US, with the sector now employing twice the number of people involved with coal mining. But the decarbonization of America’s energy system is happening at a more local level, too.
 There are 25 states with at least one community solar project online, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and 2016 was a bumper year, with 218 MW added. 
 “It’s picking up speed, and there’s a lot in the pipeline, so it’ll be a mainstream driver of solar in the future,” said Alex Hobson, a spokeswoman for the association. “There is room to grow and there’s a lot of interest from people who never thought about solar, such as those renting or who are moving out of their buildings in the near future.”
 Community solar works by allowing several people, such as those in a building with several apartments, to derive energy from a solar project installed on their building or elsewhere. Some utilities provide customers the ability to purchase the renewable energy from a shared facility, while in other cases groups of people band together to take advantage of state and federal incentives to make the investment themselves. California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota are currently leading the way.
 Agricultural activities currently contribute about 10% of America’s total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely due to the methane expelled by cattle.
 Americans are eating less beef than they did a decade ago, but further reductions would be handy if the US is to reduce its emissions to levels that would help avoid dangerous climate change. A raft of new meatless meat options have been made available for those who are reluctant about going vegetarian but can’t quite stomach the impact of meat production.
 The Impossible Burger, a fake meat offering, has gained plenty of headlines due to the fact it “bleeds” much like the real thing. The $12 burger, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Google, has confused some diners but it’s hoped it will help make people cut down on beef, saving land, water and emissions in the process. There is plenty of competition, too, from brands such as Beyond Meat, Gardein and the venerable Tofurky.
 Worldwide use of concrete is soaring, largely due to a building boom in China and, to a lesser extent, India. In fact, China has used more cement since 2011 than the US did during the entire 20th century.
 The greenhouse gas emissions in its production are significant, prompting researchers to come up with a greener alternative. In February, Rutgers University’s Richard Riman announced a new technology that can make a variety of materials, including concrete. Combined with cement, the product can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete by up to 70%, according to the university.
“I looked at how shellfish make ceramics at low-temperature, like carbonate crystals, and then looked at what people can do with water to make landing strips in Alaska, and I said we should be able to do this with ceramics, but use a low-temperature chemical process that involves water,” Riman said.
“When you can develop technologies that are safe and easy to use, it’s a game-changer.”
A technology company called WISErg has developed a product called the Harvester, which transforms food waste into fertilizer than can be applied to lawns. The product, launched in 2014, has helped the company get more than $30m in investment.
 In the same area, a startup in Connecticut is working on replacing gasoline-run mowers with a solar-charged alternative that, for each lawn, saves emissions equivalent to those of a car on the road for 12,000 miles.
 Wind currently supplies around 5% of America’s electricity but the sector is on the up thanks to the introduction of offshore wind farms.
 In December, the first US offshore wind turbines started turning near a small island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Block Island wind farm is small – capable of powering about 17,000 homes – but has opened up the way for further developments along the coast.
 Donald Trump isn’t a fan – he has fought a losing battle to prevent a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland – but the falling cost of turbines is making offshore wind more competitive. Maryland is currently mulling two different proposals for offshore wind which would dwarf the Block Island development.
 Electric vehicle sales jumped 70% in 2016, following a disappointing previous year, with more than 30 different models on sale by the end of the year. Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ford lead the way, with more than half of sales occurring in California, which mandates a certain slice of auto sales must be electric.
 Continued growth could depend on whether a federal tax credit is extended but the electric vehicle market is maturing from a niche oddity to a competitive international field. The Chinese government is calling on auto manufacturers to sell more electric vehicles to improve air quality, with Ford announcing it will electrify 70% of the vehicles sold in the country by 2025. There’s still a long way to go – many drivers still worry about the availability of recharging stations – but this is yet another clean energy market that America could lead in.
 Even the sober assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves much to guesswork when it comes to meeting emissions reduction goals. If the world is to avoid 2C or more of warming, as-yet undeveloped technology will need to be used to extract carbon dioxide from the air at some point, due to the patchy progress in cutting emissions.
 One desperate intervention could be solar engineering, which is being studied by a team led by David Keith at Harvard University. The researchers are looking at how chemical compounds, such as limestone dust, can be dispersed in the atmosphere, thereby scattering sunlight and sparing an area below from its heat. 
 How this can be achieved, and whether it is even desirable to do so, is an ongoing debate. But if we continue to cook our planet, then governments may have to turn to the likes of Keith to help avert the worst.",1085,0.02842741935483871,0.4034274193548387,0.22802419354838707,0.14334677419354838,2.0161290322580645e-4,0.05262096774193549,0.004233870967741936,2.0161290322580645e-4,0.08487903225806452,0.05463709677419355

Until now, pension schemes have been hamstrung by “fiduciary duties” that effectively require schemes to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change. Many have rebuffed calls by members for fossil fuel divestment, citing legal obligations.
But in what has been hailed as a major victory for campaigners against fossil fuels, the government is to introduce new investment regulations that will allow pension schemes to “mirror members’ ethical concerns” and “address environmental problems”.
The rules are expected to come into force next year after a consultation period and will bring into effect recommendations made in 2014 and earlier this year by the Law Commission. 
Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion, said: “Putting social value at the heart of our pensions system is something that is deeply important to Theresa May’s government. Thanks to these new regulations, savers will finally have the clear opportunity to have their say on where their money is invested and can reflect what is personally important to them, whilst delivering mutual benefits.”
About £87bn a year pours into Britain’s pension schemes, with a significant proportion of it automatically invested into gas and oil companies such as BP and Shell. But a growing body of academic and investment research suggests that reserves of fossil fuels could become “stranded assets” and virtually worthless as countries battle climate change. 
“We are committed to making it easier for people to invest in ways that reflect their values and have a positive impact on the issues they care about,” said Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport and civil society.
Once mocked by the conventional asset management industry, divestment from fossil fuels has moved beyond charity and religious groups into the investment mainstream. In November, the managers of the world’s biggest wealth fund, Norway’s sovereign $1tn fund, recommended divesting from existing oil and gas shares – it holds $5.4bn of Shell shares and $3bn in Exxon – as well as ruling out future investments.
Meanwhile, at last week’s One Planet Summit in Paris, the French financial giant Axa said it would speed up its withdrawal from coal businesses and end insurance for controversial US oil pipelines.
ShareAction, which campaigns for responsible investment, said the new UK rules would empower pension savers to use their investments to fight climate change. 
The charity’s chief executive, Catherine Howarth, said: “ShareAction has been campaigning for change in this area for years. The [Department for Work and Pensions’] decision to propose these reforms is a welcome breakthrough. 
“We urge pension savers in the UK who care about how their money is invested to let the DWP know they fully support this much-needed change in the law. As powerful investors, it is essential our pension funds focus on long-term risks and opportunities such as those connected with climate change and social inequality.”
But Howarth called on the Financial Conduct Authority to speed up its response to the Law Commission’s proposals, claiming the city regulator “is still sitting on its hands”.
Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. 
Local authority pension schemes, which hold £16bn worth of oil and gas company shares in their investment portfolios on behalf of 5.3 million workers in England and Wales, are likely to be the earliest to implement the rules in the UK. 
The Environment Agency and Southwark council in London have been among the first major schemes to divest, and as once independently run council schemes begin a pooling process, divestment is likely to spread to more authorities. 
Aon, one of the biggest advisers to pension schemes around the world, said the divestment campaign was “real and much higher up the agenda” but said many schemes would want to engage with energy companies to encourage renewable alternatives rather than selling their holdings. 
John Belgrove, a senior partner at Aon, said: “In the past, aspects around fiduciary duty and best returns have got in the way of pension trustees [wanting to divest] ... and the subject has been easily kicked into the long grass. These new regulations from the DWP are another step in a series of steps we have seen in this area. But exclusion is still pretty rare. If one looks at the big picture on fossil fuels, the biggest renewable energy developments are coming from the very same firms that extract fossil fuels.”

The late-year release of the climate policy review, which points to allowing Australian businesses to increase their emissions as their production grows, comes as new figures confirm Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions are the highest on record when emissions from land use change are excluded, as well as projections suggesting the country will increase its emissions all the way to 2030 and beyond.
The new official emissions data confirm projections produced exclusively for the Guardian six months ago. In both 2015 and 2016, the government quietly released this data showing rising emissions on the days before Christmas. This year they were released almost a week before Christmas.
The review of climate policies by the Department of Environment and Energy signals the government will keep the emissions reduction fund, the centrepiece of the Direct Action policy, but it doesn’t quantify the cost of rolling it over.
The government will have to make a decision in the May budget about how much to allocate to the fund, which currently sees taxpayers pay for carbon abatement rather than big polluters. The fund started at $2.55bn and about $260m remains in the fund now.
While some climate policy experts had thought the Turnbull government might use the review to toughen the existing safeguards mechanism in order to curb emissions growth, the climate policy review goes in the opposite direction, suggesting baselines could “increase with production, supporting business growth”.
The safeguards mechanism sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The new climate review points clearly to loosening it, to ensure business does not face restraints on growth, with changes to be implemented in the 2018-19 compliance year, in consultation with industry.
It says the mechanism needs to be “fairer and simpler” and it says changes are required to “address the risk of potential constraints on business growth raised by a number of stakeholders through the review”.
As well as opening the door for businesses to boost their emissions, the new review also flags the use of international permits to help Australia meet its international emissions reductions commitments – a practice Tony Abbott ruled out when he was prime minister.
While Abbott used to characterise the trade of international credits as “money that shouldn’t be going offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”, the climate review says “access to high-quality international units will provide greater flexibility to business and government in meeting emissions reduction targets”.
The climate policy review backs a new light vehicle fuel efficiency standard to reduce transport emissions, without being definitive, and it declares Australia will meet its international climate commitments.
It also confirms the government will in 2018 start developing “a long-term emissions reduction strategy by 2020” but it qualifies the objective by noting the “strategy will not be prescriptive”. 
Despite the climate change policy review declaring the government’s current set of policies can meet Australia’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments, the latest data shows Australia is continuing to increase its emissions, making the targets harder to achieve.
Australia’s total emissions in the three months to June 2017 were 136.2 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent – more than any other June quarter since 2011.
But the those emissions were the highest for any June quarter on record when emissions from land-use change are excluded, which the government says are the most unreliable and appear to not account for massive emissions caused by a tree-clearing crisis gripping eastern and northern Australia.
The figures now form a clear trend, with the emissions over the previous four quarters also the highest on record, when unreliable emissions from land-use change are excluded.
The government also quietly released its annual emissions projections today, concluding that, despite commitments to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, they will be higher in 2030 than they are today. 
The projections do not include any modelling of possible vehicle emissions standards, or a national energy guarantee (Neg). However, since emissions are forecast to grow in all sectors, reductions in electricity and transport will not be enough to meet the government’s 2030 targets.",701,2.8409090909090913e-4,0.36107954545454546,2.8409090909090913e-4,2.8409090909090913e-4,0.6366477272727272,2.8409090909090913e-4,2.8409090909090913e-4,2.8409090909090913e-4,2.8409090909090913e-4,2.8409090909090913e-4

The damning assessment by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is contained in the December 2018 progress report posted on its website and comes as NSW faces growing questions over whether its rivers are over-allocated in the wake of a big fish kill at Menindee on the Darling River.
Water resource plans, or water-sharing plans, set the detailed rules for sharing water between irrigators and the environment in each catchment. They include rules on how allocations will be made, when irrigators must cease pumping in low flows, pump sizes permitted, and rules for shepherding environmental flows down the river.
But NSW has failed to submit even first drafts of 12 of of its 20 required plans, including those for major rivers such as the Barwon Darling, the Lower Darling, the Namoi and the Murrumbidgee.
Instead, NSW is operating its rivers under old plans, which have not been accredited.
In particular, the 2012 Barwon Darling water-sharing plan has come in for heavy criticism because it allows irrigators to pump during low and medium flows.
The revelations of NSW’s slow progress come as as low river flows, hot weather and algal blooms in several rivers have caused massive fish kills.
The NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, denied on Tuesday there was a problem of over-allocation in NSW, saying that the primary cause of falling dam levels and low flows was the drought.
“We have water-sharing plans and we are developing and submitting our water resource plans for all across New South Wales to be signed off by Canberra,” he said. “This is not a debate about over-allocation.
“This is a drought. For people to jump on the bandwagon now and point the finger at farmers and tell them they are responsible for this – go and look at the records.
But the water-sharing plans Blair was referring to are incomplete and NSW lagging is far behind other states.
The MDBA said 12 of NSW’s were only at the “preliminary phase” in which NSW outlines its approach to the MDBA. The MDBA rated its level of confidence of NSW meeting the deadline at 30% or less.
“The MDBA remains concerned about the large volume of work that needs to be completed,” the report said. “At this stage MDBA considers that eight of the 20 NSW WRPs are on track for accreditation by mid-2019.
While the authority said NSW was co-operating, it said the state still needed to resolve a number of complex policy implementation issues to enable the accreditation of its plans.
These included floodplain harvesting, water accounting issues and the protection of environmental water in the northern NSW catchments.",464,0.06536796536796537,4.329004329004329e-4,4.329004329004329e-4,0.2688311688311688,0.42467532467532465,4.329004329004329e-4,0.2341991341991342,0.004761904761904762,4.329004329004329e-4,4.329004329004329e-4

The Israeli academic, whose first book, Sapiens, became a surprise publishing sensation by charting the rise of the human species, turns his attention to current affairs for the first time with a swipe at what he argues is a short-sighted response to global challenges in countries such as the UK, US, Russia and Israel.
“Brexit may well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the UK and the EU. But in the long run, history’s direction is clear cut,” he writes. “In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been blending into a single global civilisation.”
The new book, 21 lessons for the 21st Century, is published in August and comes amid a period of unprecedented introspection in British politics over how to leave the European Union. Yet Harari argues the coming challenges of global warming, technological disruption and nuclear proliferation will make us “ever more interdependent” and in need of cooperative projects such as the EU.
“In a different century and different situation, I don’t think there is anything necessarily wrong about Brexit,” he added in an interview. “If you want to be a completely independent country and not part of a bigger organisation, then fine. The problem is that given the kind of challenges we face today, the opportunity costs of being very self absorbed are becoming higher and higher all the time.”
The thesis may infuriate Brexit supporters who regard it as a way for Britain to look out to the world more, but Harari also has words of criticism for liberals who regard the EU referendum as a catastrophe.
“Like a person imagining that a bad headache signifies a terminal brain tumour, many liberals fear that Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump portend the end of human civilisation,” he writes. “The first step is to tone down the prophecies of gloom and switch from panic mode to bewilderment … more humble, and therefore more clear-sighted.”
He also claims it is not inevitable that humanity will learn to collaborate more, warning of a possible “unravelling” of the EU in the wake of Brexit – with worrying implications.
“If the European project fails … it would indicate that belief in the liberal values of freedom and tolerance is not enough to resolve the cultural conflicts of the world,” writes Harari. “If Greeks and Germans cannot agree on a common destiny, and if 500 million affluent Europeans cannot absorb a few million impoverished refugees, what chances do humans have of overcoming the far deeper conflicts that beset our global civilisation?”
“Let’s say the rise of artificial intelligence completely disrupts the global job market, this will create far far bigger social and economic challenges than the immigration of a few million people to the EU or some workers from Poland and Romania to the UK,” he added.
Harari, who lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was also critical of Israeli nationalism in the wake of the killing of Palestinian protesters last week.
“If every nation thinks about itself, then who is thinking about the global problems?” he said. “I don’t see Israel making any significant contribution to confronting the main challenges of humankind.”
But the book singles out the EU as a model for how national interests can be balanced and what is at stake if it fails.
“After centuries of terrible bloodshed, French, Germans, Italians and Britons have finally built a mechanism that ensures continental harmony – only to have the British public throw a spanner into the miracle machine,” writes Harari.
“We have a global ecology, a global economy and a global science – but we are still stuck with only national politics,” he adds. “To have effective politics we must either deglobalise the ecology, the economy or the march of science – or we must globalise our politics.”",657,0.003536977491961415,0.003536977491961415,3.215434083601286e-4,3.215434083601286e-4,0.003536977491961415,0.11929260450160772,0.33472668810289385,0.08392282958199357,3.215434083601286e-4,0.45048231511254017

Waves of almost four metres in the weekend storm left beach flags fluttering in tatters, forced the closure of deckchair-rental gazebos, and inundated coconut-and-beer kiosks with grit and sea water.
Tourists who had expected to bask in the glorious sunshine that is normal at the start of the southern hemisphere summer walked ponderously along a shoreline that is only slowly recovering from the unseasonal buffeting, while local traders lamented the collapse in business.
“This is the worst I have seen in the 20 years since I started working here,” said Dominique Souza as he surveyed the aftermath of the storm surge at Post 11 in Leblon: giant heaps of sand, cracked pavements and deluged public toilets. He estimated a more than 80% fall in sales over the past few days at his baraca (beach stall) that sells cold drinks and rents parasols.
Although he expects business to pick up as soon as the weather improves, climate scientists are debating whether wave-slamming on this scale poses an increasing threat to Rio’s beach economy, which is estimated to be worth 2bn reais (£509m/$622m) a year and directly and indirectly employs more than 230,000 people. 
In the 1990s, storm surge disruptions occurred roughly once a year, but since 2010 they have hit Rio four or five times as frequently. There have already been four this year, including two of the biggest ever seen. In April, two people were killed when a 50-metre stretch of the Tim Maia bike path was washed away just months after it was built. 
This time what was left of the bike path was temporarily shut down – along with the Delfim Moreira Avenue – to prevent further fatalities and damage. One pedestrian area was also closed off due to subsidence risks, and a wooden deck area – the Mirante do Leblon – was damaged. 
David Zee, oceanography professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said the immediate cause of the swell was a cyclone off the coast of Uruguay combined with the high tide of a new moon. But he said the timing and scale of the extreme weather event posed longer-term climate concerns.
“This storm surge is not normal at this time of the year. The surges usually happen in August or September at the latest and they are not so big. This indicates that, without a doubt, the climate is altering.”
The increasing frequency of the storms is hindering Rio’s beaches’ ability to recuperate, leading to erosion along stretches of the shoreline at Copacabana, Arproador and Macumba, and accumulation elsewhere, such as Leblon.
Vitor Zanetti, of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics, called on the government and local businesses to respond to what he predicted would become a growing trend. “This was an extreme climate event,” he said. “The one thing all climate scientists agree on is that we will see more storms and droughts.”
With the latest wave dumping sand and water in buildings across the street from the beach, he suggested hotels relocate their lobbies to higher floors. We need to start thinking about adaptation,” he said. 
But there is no consensus on the causes. 
Alfredo Silveira, an associate professor of synoptic meteorology at Rio’s Federal University, said the size of the surge was within the predictable patterns of wave behaviour rather than the result of climate change. “There is no mystery in its definition or origin. It was predicted and well documented. But it was a bit outside of the usual time frame, a bit late.”
Others meteorologists blamed El Niño, though its impact faded earlier this year. Hugo Abi Karam, a meteorologist from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, was more inclined to blame the surge on local factors, such as silt accumulation, poor drainage, seafront construction
But there is little doubt that Rio – like much of south-east Brazil – is suffering more storm surges, extreme rainfall and protracted droughts.
Given these long-term trends, Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory coalition of NGOs, said the recent wave damage was the latest sign that Brazil must fulfil its responsibilities to reduce carbon emissions, when it joins other countries in United Nations climate talks later this week. 
“This shows the high degree of vulnerability to climate change in Brazil, which has 7,400km of shoreline and 25% of its population living on the coast,” he said. “This extreme weather event must at least draw attention to the need for the country to be consistent on its climate policy – and not invest in more fossil fuels thinking that it has already done a lot to curb emissions.”",798,0.6660621761658032,0.008031088082901554,0.1272020725388601,0.02616580310880829,2.5906735751295336e-4,0.008031088082901554,0.11424870466321244,2.5906735751295336e-4,2.5906735751295336e-4,0.0494818652849741

I grieve that she will know silent and empty places | Christine Milne,Australia’s white lemuroid possum became my symbol for habitat loss and global warming that will send one-third of species to extinction by mid-century,"It was 8 November, 2011 and I had just had one of the best days of my parliamentary career. We had made history when the Senate adopted legislation to implement an emissions trading scheme to address global warming. I was both exhausted and excited, having negotiated and shepherded the legislation through the senate for the Greens. It had been a long haul over many years.
Then an email landed in my inbox; after some preliminary congratulations, the writer and vice-chancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, asked why I was wearing a polar bear badge in the newspaper photographs and not one representing an Australian animal.
I thought: “Oh for goodness’ sake, why can’t people just for once be pleased?” I decided to ignore it but then I checked out the sender and decided to reply. I wrote back pointing out that what I was wearing was an artwork, a brooch by Léa Stein, not a badge. I explained that I had deliberately chosen to wear the polar bear brooch for the debate because polar bears are the globally recognised symbol of global warming. They rely on the Arctic sea ice for hunting, breeding and travelling. With record temperatures in the Arctic, the ice is melting and retreating earlier in the spring and refreezing later in the autumn when eventually the temperatures drop. The changing pattern of ice habitat threatens their ability to feed, find a mate and raise cubs. There is nothing sadder than knowing that polar bears are drowning because of the loss of Arctic ice.
However, the critic of the polar bear brooch was not deterred. She told me she could produce a badge featuring an Australian white lemuroid ringtail possum, and that I should wear it to highlight the plight of tropical species far more endangered by global warming in the short term than polar bears. 
 I agreed to wear it at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban in 2011. The beautiful white lemuroid ringtail possum used to make up about 40% of the population of possums that live in the cool misty rainforest above 1100 metres on Mount Lewis in tropical north Queensland. It was featured in the campaigns to protect the Wet Tropics in the 1980s. Biologist William Laurance, distinguished research professor at James Cook University, wrote:
Much has been written about how global warming will affect the colder parts of the planet – the polar and boreal regions, glaciers, and alpine mountains. In fact, some of the warmest places on Earth, especially tropical rainforests, could also be intensely vulnerable to climate change … many people are unaware that tropical species – particularly those specialised for cool, cloudy mountaintops – are often sensitive to hot weather … as temperatures rise mountaintop specialists have nowhere to go. Their populations will wither and shrink and potentially disappear altogether.
While recognising the impacts of global warming on polar bears, he pointed out that creatures living near the poles have adapted to seasonal swings in temperature, whereas tropical zone species are thermal specialists adapted to a narrow stable temperature range. He added that tropical species endangered by global warming probably outnumber their polar counterparts by 1,000 to one.
He illustrated the point by referring to the mass death of a colony of giant fruit bats in New South Wales on 12 January 2002 when the temperature soared to 42.9C, eight degrees higher than the average summer maximum: 
The fruit bats normally just doze in the treetops through the day but on this afternoon they were fanning themselves, panting frantically, jostling for shady spots and licking their wrists in a desperate effort to cool down. Suddenly when the thermometer hit 42C the bats began falling from the trees. Most quickly died. The research team led by Justin Welbergen counted 1,453 dead from one colony alone.
The same thing happened in February 2014 when 45,500 fruit bats died in a single day as temperatures in Queensland rose to 42–44C. In December 2016 young bats started dropping out of trees in large numbers. The mothers had flown off, and the babies were not attached. They gradually dropped lower down the trees as they starved to death until they fell out. The causes were thought to be the El Niño weather pattern and loss of food and habitats as more land is cleared. 
Over the weekend of 14 February 2017 south-eastern Australia was the hottest place on the planet. The mercury hit 46C, and thousands of bats fell dead to the ground.
Steve Williams and his team, also of James Cook University, specialise in the study of the impacts of global warming on tropical wildlife. They concluded in 2009 that species extinctions will increase dramatically if temperatures rise more than two or three degrees and that most of the wildlife found only in North Queensland will be wiped out entirely if temperatures rise the four to six degrees that is projected in the absence of a global concerted effort to restrict the rise to less than two degrees. 
By 2016 Williams had observed that many endemic birds of the wet tropics are experiencing retracted ranges and have already moved uphill with only one degree of warming. He told me that the only other population of possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) not on Mount Lewis has had to move higher up the Atherton Tablelands; at 1,000 metres you can find the animals but there are none in what used to be the lower part of its range below 700 metres. It is not a good sign for the diversity of life in the tropical forests. Once at the top of the mountain, there is nowhere else to go.
The white lemuroid possum was thought likely to be the first mammal globally to be driven to extinction solely by global warming, but that sad place has now been taken by a small rodent, the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), which lived only on a single low-lying island off the eastern Torres Strait. It was last seen in 2009. It is likely to have been driven to extinction by sea-level rise and ocean inundation, destroying its habitat and killing many individual animals.
The white lemuroid ringtail possum is not far behind. In late 2005 a severe heatwave hit the Mount Lewis region, coinciding with a failed wet season. Without misty cloud cover the possums could not withstand the heat and died. The survey conducted afterwards found only four possums, but since then there has been a very slow recovery. But with more extreme and more frequent heatwaves predicted as the world warms, it is only a matter of time before such an event coincides again with clear skies, and that will prove fatal for the white lemuroid possum on Mount Lewis.
Just how empty and silent the seas and those landscapes become depends on us
Having agreed to take the badges to Durban and feeling devastated by the realisation that the possums’ extinction was looking me in the face, I began wondering if Léa Stein would design a white lemuroid possum brooch, not just because it would be beautiful but for global distribution as a way of raising awareness of the fact that global warming combined with habitat loss from mining and logging, urban expansion, commercial agriculture and invasive species will send one-third of all species to extinction by 2050. Stop for a minute and take that in.
Though Sandra Harding had delivered a badge to commemorate this magnificent creature, I put to her the idea of a Léa Stein brooch and asked for her assistance in having the university prepare and translate into French the work of their researchers and provide a high-quality image so I could send them to Stein. I talked to Léa Stein’s agent in Australia, Bruna Harrison of Harlequin Jewellers in Sydney, and put the idea to her; she was enthusiastic. Bruna told me that Léa, now in her eighties, is a recluse but still produces two designs a year. She does not use computers and has to be approached in person, so Bruna agreed that if information and a photo could be provided, together with a letter from me, she would give them to Lea on her next buying trip to Paris. Léa told Bruna that she would consider it.
A year went by, and I had given up thinking that anything would come of the idea. Then I heard from Bruna, who had been in Paris and could report that Léa had been working on the design but was having trouble with the tail. Finally the brooch was completed, in six different variations of texture. Three hundred were made available for early release in Australia before the global release in 2015. We were all incredibly excited that our project was about to materialise, and were quite blown away when we saw the brooches for the first time – a badge had been transformed into a stylised and stylish artwork. The brooch was launched most appropriately at the Global Tropical Biodiversity Conference at James Cook University in Cairns in 2014.
I had been invited to deliver a keynote address there, and it seemed appropriate to bring together the Australian team who had made the brooch happen and the scientists on whose work we relied, and to celebrate as a group. It is a modern example of the age-old ways women work, in families, communities and life in general. This was a tale of four women: a French artist, a university vice-chancellor, a small business proprietor and an Australian Greens party leader, working together and combining our ideas, our skills, our nous and our networks to produce something beautiful, meaningful and multilayered.
When I wear that brooch, it is a statement that at the poles and in the tropics, our fellow species, which we have known and loved, are on their way to extinction. 
I have a granddaughter who will be 35 in 2050. According to modelling of business as usual provided by Sophie Lewis at the Australian National University, the global land temperature will have increased by just over three degrees from my birth to when my granddaughter turns 35. I grieve that she will know silent and empty places where polar bears, white lemuroid possums, orang­utans, elephants, giraffes and a myriad other species on land and in the oceans once lived. 
Although the Great Barrier Reef will already be dead, just how empty and silent the seas and those landscapes become depends on us. It is why I will never stop being a campaigner to address global warming, environmental degradation, overpopulation and over-consumption, and I will never stop standing up to the governments and corporations that continue to drive them.
We are living in the Anthropocene, a period in the Earth’s history in which we humans have altered all the systems that support life on Earth. We are destroying the habitat that we and our fellow creatures need to survive. We live on a finite planet, yet we behave as if an increasing global population can continue to consume the Earth’s resources from forests and fisheries to fossil fuels at an accelerating rate and nothing will change. When I was born in 1953, the global population was 2.5 billion; it is now over 7 billion, and by 2050 it is projected to be more than 9 billion. 
If everyone consumes at the current rate of those of us in the developed world, why would we think that anything other than a reduced number of humans will have a place to live? When you add to that the impact of invasive species and overlay it with global warming, changing the climate and threatening food and water security for everything from plankton, plants and insects to reptiles, birds, animals and humans, you cannot escape the fact that we are living in the sixth wave of extinction and destroying our own home.

She will remain leader until the end of August when her second two-year term expires, but said she was making the announcement now to allow possible successors plenty of time to come forward.
The Green leader, who took over from the better known Caroline Lucas, came to national prominence during last year’s general election campaign, when she appeared in the televised party leaders’ debates alongside David Cameron and Ed Miliband.
However, she was forced to apologise to members after an excruciating radio interview in which she failed to explain Green party policies, which she put down to “brain fade” and suffering a cold. 
Reflecting on her time as the head of the party, Bennett said: “There have been times when I got things right, and times when I got things wrong, but that’s because I’m not a smooth, spin-trained, lifelong politician,” she said. “It’s both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.” She argued that sometimes, because the Greens’ policies are radical, they have received “a very extreme level of hostility”.
The party ended up holding its single MP in Brighton and bringing its share of the vote up slightly to 3.8%, but despite growing its membership from 13,000 to 60,000 under her leadership the party ultimately failed to break through as Green members had hoped and Labour had feared.
The Australian former Guardian journalist, who only joined the party in 2006, said she had always intended to serve for four years, and felt she had achieved much of what she hoped to do when she took up the post in 2012. “I started with a number of intentions: making the Green party a truly national party; growing the membership; growing the strength of our local parties; and getting us into national debates.”
“In the Green party it’s not a greasy pole where people are scrambling for the top and clinging on by their fingertips: we work as a team,” she said. “I think of everybody in the Green party as a leader: we’re all trying to lead us to be a society where we live within our environmental limits, and where no one is left behind”.
She said grassroots initiatives, such as the “transition towns” that are trying to move towards life without fossil fuels, are evidence that the public care about the environment, but real change has to come from the top. 
“The reason I got involved in the Green party is that at the moment they’re having to work against the grain: they’re having to fight all the way, without support from the law, the framework, the funding that should be supporting them.”
The party secured 1.1m votes at last year’s general election but Bennett failed in her own bid to win a parliamentary seat, standing in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency against Keir Starmer, the Labour candidate and former director of public prosecutions. The party also failed to take target seats such as Norwich South and Bristol West, and lost control of its only council, in Brighton. 
The party did not make much headway in the May elections this year, apart from gaining MSPs in Scotland and coming third in the London mayoral elections, and also faces a challenge in how to compete with a more leftwing Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn.
Caroline Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010, remains the party’s only representative in the House of Commons. But Bennett stressed that the 123 of the party’s candidates saved their deposits nationwide, a sharp improvement on its historical performance.
She said the party’s strong showing in areas such as Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool, outside traditional strongholds such as Bristol and Brighton, shows that it has now become a political force across Britain. “We’ve very much grown up, and developed, and become a truly national party. We are now spread right across the country.”
Bennett was a little-known figure on the nationwide political stage when she appeared in the TV debates, and she believes her presence, along with Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood and the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, helped to change the nature of the debate.
“One of the things I’m proudest of is being able, in those national debates, to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his position on Syrian refugees,” she said.
She added: “It really is telling that I was the only one to talk about climate change in those two debates. It’s a real indictment of the other parties when you think about how pressing these issues are.” Her message was that “environmental problems are inextricably linked to the structure of the economy and society.”
She said grassroots activists and members have helped support her, offering their spare bedrooms and their time and enthusiasm as she has travelled around the country. “I have a fraction of the resources of other party leaders,” she said. “Sometimes I have just handed my phone to someone and said, ‘media manage me for the day’.”
Bennett has sometimes struggled to compete with the public profile of Lucas – herself a former Green leader – who is likely to be a strong contender to succeed her. The Scottish Green leader, Patrick Harvie, is also regarded as a powerful campaigner.
Bennett said she hoped another contribution of the debates last year was to make young people realise that women, from different walks of life, can succeed in politics. “Young women, seeing us all in the debates, thought, ‘that could be me’,” she said. However, she added: “There are huge problems with the sheer narrowness of where our political class comes from.”
Once Bennett has stepped down, she plans to spend more time travelling the country – her favourite part of her job as leader – and campaigning on issues she feels strongly about, including education, where she believes the government’s testing regime has turned schools into “exam factories”.

The debate is what is that influence and what can we do’,"Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of interior, Ryan Zinke, distanced himself from the president-elect on Tuesday, saying “the climate is changing. The debate is what is that influence and what can we do”.
Zinke, a two-term congressman for Montana, had been asked by Bernie Sanders about Trump’s infamous 2012 tweet where the real estate developer described climate change as “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”.
Zinke, a former navy Seal, responded by stating matter of factly, “I don’t believe it’s a hoax.” 
The statement came in a hearing on his nomination held by the Senate energy and natural resources committee on Tuesday.
However, the Trump cabinet nominee insisted he wasn’t “a climate science expert” and stated his belief in “being prudent” towards what he characterized as “a lot of debate on both sides of the aisle”.
Zinke also differed from many in his own party by insisting: “I’m absolutely against transfer or sale of public lands.” Many Republicans have long pushed for the federal government to transfer ownership of public lands to the states, and this was included as a plank in the party’s platform. However, the Montana Republican still made clear his support for fossil fuel drilling on federal lands, saying “We have to have an economy.”
Zinke is expected to sail through the Senate with bipartisan support. He was introduced by both of his state’s senators, Democrat Jon Tester and Republican Steve Daines, before the hearing on Tuesday. Zinke had long been considered the strongest general election opponent to Tester in 2018 but his appointment likely prevents him from seeking a Senate bid and boosts Democratic chances of holding onto Tester’s seat in the midterms.",279,7.299270072992701e-4,7.299270072992701e-4,7.299270072992701e-4,0.008029197080291971,7.299270072992701e-4,7.299270072992701e-4,7.299270072992701e-4,0.008029197080291971,0.9788321167883212,7.299270072992701e-4

That all changed during the 2008 financial crisis, after which he experienced an epiphany “because it convinced him that the officer class in business and in politics did not know what it was doing”.
After his epiphany, Moran formed a collective of academics dedicated to exposing the complacency of finance-worship and to replacing it with an idea of running modern economies focused on maximising social good. They called themselves the Foundational Economy Collective, based on the idea that it’s in the everyday economy where there is most potential for true social regeneration: not top-down cash-splashing, but renewal and replenishment from the ground upwards.
It hurts nobody to bring local services back into local authority control and to divest from outsourcing firms
Foundational activities are the materials and services without which we cannot live a civilised life: clean, unrationed water; affordable electricity and gas without cuts to supply; collective transport on smooth roads and rails; quality health and social care provided free at the point of use; and reliable, sustainable food supply. Then there’s the “overlooked economy” – everyday services such as hairdressing, veterinary care, catering and hospitality and small-scale manufacturing – which employ far more people, across a wider geographical range, than the “high-skill, hi-tech” economy with which recent governments have been obsessed.
For the Foundational Economy authors, focusing on the fundamental value of invisible and unglamorous jobs “restores the importance of unappreciated and unacknowledged tacit skills of many citizens”. It’s a way of looking at economics from the point of view of people rather than figures, and doing something revolutionary (yet so blindingly obvious) in the process. What is the point of “growth” if the basic elements of a decent life are denied to a large and growing number?
Because everybody has these everyday needs, their provision is not – or ought not to be – specific to one or a few regions, and is comparatively resistant to automation. If applied by government as a central plank of industrial strategy, prioritising the foundational economy could fundamentally transform people’s quality of life outside London and the south-east – which would be the direct opposite of the dire “northern powerhouse” template that has only created even more cynicism.
Visions of an economy run for social good, rather than individual gain, are being developed by Labour through a series of regional workshops on the “new economics”. As the examples of Preston, Enfield and Oldham councils have shown, it hurts nobody to bring services back into local authority control and to divest from the outsourcing firms whose own definition of “growth”’ is extracting profit from social misery.
Any future government will have to take this vision seriously. Take Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of “a million climate jobs” at last month’s Labour conference, which could be a conservative estimate for the task at hand. In 2012, Oxfam reported that 4.7m jobs could be supported and £280bn added to the economy if the government invested in retro-fitting the entire existing housing stock for lower energy consumption. (It could also save a total £8.7bn a year from our domestic fuel bills.) Our homes are the most expensive to heat in Europe, and the oldest, with more than 60% built before 1960.
A change in thinking is urgently required to bring about a permanent and ongoing renewal of the foundations of a good society.
This brings to mind a long-buried yet prescient quote by Raymond Williams. In his 1960 novel Border Country, he describes a character witnessing “a slow and shocking cancellation of the future” in the wake of the 1926 general strike. This quote has been leapt upon in recent years by a reinvigorated and youthful left.
It’s as though, nearly 60 years later, we’ve woken up to the idea that a better future can be reinstated, but that we have to get it back ourselves. Restoring decent basic services for everyone, then keeping the bar high for everyone, is a task akin to painting and repainting the Forth Bridge, and this alone is enough to keep millions of people in stable, valuable work.
For a future better than the one we’re dreading, we need to start rebuilding the foundations now.

No wonder the school strikers call adults immature, says environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey","Since August 2018 a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, has sat outside her country’s parliament building every Friday rather than in a classroom. She is there to demand that the government takes climate action by implementing the 2015 Paris agreement. While some thought she would give up her strike, her resolve could not be broken by the cold, heat or disapproval from adults.
Last Friday children in 72 countries joined what have come to be known as the school strikes against climate change. It is important to note that one of the pillars on which the strike hangs is the Paris climate accord globally endorsed in 2015 at the 21st conference of parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taken alongside the UN sustainable development goals, the hope is that global temperature rises above preindustrial levels can be kept at 1.5C or “well below” 2C. It is also hoped that with the development goals poverty and hunger can be terminated by 2050. Are these attainable targets?
Negotiations on pathways of implementing the Paris climate agreement underscore the fact that there is a global agreement that countries must take action. But the indications of how this would be achieved are not at the level of ambition needed to counter, slow or stop the looming climate chaos. The problem with voluntary emissions reduction by nations is that such actions would only achieve the targets if the key polluters do their fair share of cutting emissions at source. This is not the scenario that is playing out, however. A special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicated that the current ambition as set out until 2030 will likely result in a global warming of about 3C by 2100 and that this warming would continue. Unless the most polluting nations raise their emissions reduction ambitions, we are on track towards the literal incineration of the planet.
Extreme weather events are already wreaking havoc on many regions. Small-island developing nations are at extreme risk of being swallowed up by the oceans. Nigeria and other African nations are at risk of highly challenged agricultural systems and intensified poverty regimes. Even with the best socioeconomic improvements in our nations, the consequences of 1.5C or 2C temperature increase will mean elevated health risks, water stress, human insecurity, damaged livelihoods and lowered levels of wellbeing. Temperature rises will lead to increased desertification, higher ocean acidification and migration of marine species to higher latitudes.
The impacts on my home country, Nigeria, will be dire. Water stress will be higher in the Sahelian area and this will compel a higher rate of southward migration of pastoralists and farmers. Ocean acidification and coastal erosion, on the other hand, will force coastal communities to relocate into the hinterland. This is a scenario that will breed conflict.
The strike for climate action is a significant step by children and teenagers, especially because it is their future that is at stake. Thunberg has been clear in her many speeches to policymakers and leaders. She insists that nations must wake up and that their sluggishness is a mark of laziness and irresponsibility. At the UN climate change conference in Katowice in December, she pointedly stated: “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.”
One of the clear ways to apply that brake is to quickly phase out the dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and transportation. The truth is that the world must abandon fossil fuels within this century. The decline in use of this dirty energy must happen now. Rather than take this pathway, politicians lend their ears to fossil fuel corporations even in the corridors of the UN climate change conferences. Rather than cut emissions, the tendency is towards what is termed net-zero emissions.
This means a polluter can keep polluting once they buy a licence for the actions by showing that an equivalent amount is being absorbed by trees in a poor community’s forest or that similar amounts are absorbed by the oceans or are reflected back into space through geoengineering. Sadly, Nigeria keeps flaring gas in the Niger Delta – a major local contributor of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our government’s deadline for ending gas flaring in 2020 does not appear achievable given progress on the ground.
When children call adults immature, we must be attentive. It is not an insult. It is a plea for us to think of the future of our children. They insist that if there is no future there is no reason to sit in a classroom. We must listen to the children. Children of the world must unite in this struggle to force adults away from short-term measures predicated on profit, political gains and their lack of concern for the planet and the future.

Direct Energy, a US energy company wholly owned by Centrica, donated $20,000 to the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) in 2010, according to tax filings.
The Austin-based thinktank has rubbished climate change science, argued the Paris climate deal would “wreak havoc” in the US economy and said the idea of keeping fossil fuels in the ground was a “ridiculous construct”. 
Rick Perry, who was picked by Trump for energy secretary on Wednesday, wrote a book in 2010 that praised the thinktank for opposing “environmental policy based on the hysteria of global warming”. The TPPF also has relationships with other top Republicans, including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz.
Centrica told the Guardian it did not share the thinktank’s views on climate change, but confirmed it was still donating via its subsidiary and had no plans to stop.
Greenpeace, which first spotted the Centrica link to the TPPF, urged the company to “rethink who they give money to” and rule out donating to “climate sceptic outfits”.
Hannah Martin, energy campaigner at the group, said: “Centrica claims to be ‘a world leader for action on climate change’ but has been donating thousands of dollars to a climate sceptic thinktank with links to Trump’s new energy secretary, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz. 
“Perhaps it’s just a case of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing, but this can only undermine Centrica’s credibility on tackling climate change.”
In total, $4.7m was donated by 129 individuals, corporations and foundations to the TPPF in 2010, tax documents inadvertently published online show. The Koch brothers, who have bankrolled opposition to climate change action across the US, were among the biggest donors, and the list includes oil companies ExxonMobil and Chevron.
In addition to Perry, the TPPF has links to Trump’s team through Doug Domenech, head of the president-elect’s interior department transition team, who has called carbon dioxide a “trace greenhouse gas”.
Domenech is director of the thinktank’s Fuelling Freedom project, for which he has penned numerous articles attacking action on climate change. “Under the Clean Power Plan more people will suffer – and for no benefit to our climate,” he wrote of Barack Obama’s flagship energy plan to move away from fossil fuels.
Writing about a recent conference of climate change sceptics in Washington, organised by the TPPF, he said: “Is climate change real? Yes, it has happened in the past and will happen in the future. Is man making an impact on the climate? Perhaps but in very small ways. But the overarching consensus remains the climate change we are experiencing is by no means catastrophic.”
Centrica said its donations to the thinktank were entirely unrelated to its stance on the environment. 
“We have a very clear position on climate change and we believe in the need to take material action to reduce the effect of fossil fuels on climate change,” a spokesman said. “We do not make contributions to any organisation to advocate specifically for a position on the environment and the Texas Public Policy Foundation is no exception.”
Centrica acquired the Houston-headquartered Direct Energy in 2000 for £406m. The company is the biggest residential energy supplier in North America, serving nearly 5m households and businesses. 
Centrica said it donated to the TPPF because it shared some of its views on a “well-structured” retail electricity market. It is not clear exactly how much the company has donated in total to the thinktank but the Guardian understands the most recent donation was of the same order of magnitude as the $20,000 given in 2010.
On Thursday, Centrica upgraded its annual profit forecast, partly due to a stronger-than-expected performance by its north American businesses. Earnings per share are up 6.5% to 16.5p, and the company’s adjusted operating cash flow is to be £2.4bn to £2.6bn, up from more than £2bn previously.",652,3.1746031746031746e-4,0.14317460317460318,0.14,3.1746031746031746e-4,3.1746031746031746e-4,0.03841269841269841,3.1746031746031746e-4,0.04793650793650794,0.5780952380952381,0.051111111111111114

So are Indigenous people ready for the end?,"The Doomsday Clock, used by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists for the last 70 years to indicate the danger level of global nuclear annihilation, was recently moved to “two-and-a-half minutes to midnight”.
On an Aboriginal timeline, we might recall much older lore about uranium, which warns of a monster that must be left in the ground or it will destroy the earth with fire; or the blue tongue lizard Dreaming story warning about radioactive poison. 
Indigenous reasoning does not tolerate isolated variables, so from an Aboriginal perspective you can’t ignore the interconnected issues. The threat of nuclear apocalypse is occurring during the greatest species extinction event in aeons. Rare earth metal refining – for the solar panels we all put our hopes in – produces tons of radioactive waste that can’t be safely stored. The disaster site at Fukushima continues to leak. Nuclear-armed developing nations in South Asia are running out of water. Developed nations globally are running out of topsoil. And the broader impacts of climate change are already being felt. 
When people wonder what the post-apocalypse world will look like, just ask an Indigenous person, we survived and have been living in it.
I'm very fond of saying that as Indigenous people ""Survival is our Superpower"". We have survived the apocalypse of colonization &amp; genocide.
I’ve been thinking a lot about the end of the world. It seems many Indigenous people have. The theme has become prolific in First Nations art, literature, film and television. Search online and you can find hundreds of tweets and blogs about it, with a common theme: a confidence that we’ll be the only ones to survive.
In bookstores I found Indigenous speculative fiction novels like the dystopian futurist works of Sam Watson and Alexis Wright, and the adolescent fiction of Palyku writer Ambelin Kwaymullina, creator of the Tribe trilogy – Australia’s answer to the Hunger Games. The TV series Cleverman, produced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, offered up a futuristic black superhero to make me feel like I would outlast the Doomsday Clock.
Dr Duane Hamacher from Monash University has spent years studying ancient oral histories of geological events. “For over 65,000 years, the First Peoples of this continent have experienced major catastrophes,” he tells me. “These have included volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, meteorite impacts and rapid sea level rises. The people survived, and so did the stories.” 
Hamacher attributes this survival to the immense complexity and adaptive capacity of First Nations cultures. But does this resilience in the face of natural disasters characterise Indigenous responses to colonisation as well?
Last week I went to a Melbourne Fringe festival event: a First Nations response to the end of the world that took the form of an art party called Apocalypse in Blak. 
Created by Nayuka Gorrie and the Koori Heritage Trust, the show explored cycles of adaptation beyond the Anthropocene era in dance and electronic sound pieces. It was interspersed with spoken word and free-for-all audience participation – with a bratty “whatever” mood throughout.
Colonisation was our apocalypse, and we are already living in a dystopian future, so we are ahead of the game.
“Colonisation was our apocalypse, and we are already living in a dystopian future, so we are ahead of the game,” Gorrie says. “Part of me is excited about what comes next as an opportunity to take my country back, a chance to assert sovereignty.” 
Then she goes for the jugular with a cheeky byte that will likely see her inbox filled with hate mail: “Colonists are about to experience their own apocalypse, but whose land can they steal next to survive it?”
Dr Larry Gross is chair of Native American Studies at the University of Redlands in California. An Anishinaabe man of the Minnesota Chippewa, Gross has published and spoken extensively on a theory he coined, called post-apocalyptic stress syndrome (Pass). He defines it as: “When a culture experiences such a massive shock that it never fully recovers.” 
Gross has identified this syndrome in both Indigenous and settler communities. Recent examples include white manufacturing workers in the American mid-west, whose way of life came to an end with the collapse of their industry. Historically, he finds the same indicators of Pass in population data from Europe after the Black Death plagues in the 14th century. 
“The Europe that came out of the Black Death was not the same as the Europe that went in,” Gross tells me. He draws parallels between this event, and the Indigenous experience of colonisation. “Both resulted in an intergenerational pandemic of post traumatic stress disorder, suicide and widespread substance abuse.”
Gross sees potential apocalyptic crises today as opportunities for reconciliation, drawing from his study of historical Indigenous and European holocausts: “Since the Europeans went through an apocalypse and suffered the exact same symptoms as Indigenous people, this indicates that we are not as different as we might like to think.”
Melbourne’s West Space Gallery is currently hosting Every Second Feels Like a Century, a collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous curators Hannah Presley and Debbie Pryor. In a determined “race against destruction”, the exhibit litters a small gallery space with stylised doomsday prepper kits, crystallised fossil replicas of Coke bottles and Nikes, and traditional tools alongside urban foraging equipment. 
Tasmanian Indigenous artist Nicholas Hovington presents a resurrective shrine of skin and bones – a grisly homage to a time when the bounty for shooting thylacines was the same as for shooting Tasmanian Aboriginal people. Star Dreaming and Turtle lore are flagged for a revival, to bring on a cataclysm described cryptically by Worimi artist Adam Ridgeway as “good hurt now, big debt one”. There are complex layers to this exhibit that are worth unpacking.
Presley recounts the impact the stolen generation had on her family, and how it influenced her approach to the exhibit. “I thought about my own grandfather, whose mother rubbed him with charcoal to keep him with her,” she told me. “That moment he was stolen could be interpreted as an apocalypse for our family.” She incorporated the same colour of charcoal into the exhibition design.
According to Gross, it takes at least a century for a population to adapt after post-apocalyptic stress syndrome. In the meantime there is an understandable need to express both mourning and bravado in response to world-changing events. You can see it as a therapeutic way of coming to grips with past trauma without drowning in victimhood and despair in the present.
If you can’t remember what wattles indicate about the fish in the river, then you’re going to have a bad apocalypse
But while assertions of Indigenous peoples’ end-times advantage are often delivered with an empowering kind of smugness, it’s not always justified. In my case particularly, it’s been almost a year since I ate dugong or used a spear, and city living in that time has made my feet as soft as my rapidly-expanding buttocks. I doubt my capacity to hunt escaped pets for meat, or fight off mutants after the bomb drops. No matter what your tribe is, if you haven’t noticed the wattle flowering in this season or can’t remember what that indicates about the fish in the river, then you’re going to have a bad apocalypse.
Many of our people might struggle with the lack of vegan options available in post-nuclear urban foraging, or with the disturbing realisation that being black, proud and fabulous doesn’t make you any better qualified to knock a zombie’s brains out with a boomerang.

That’s why at 71 I’m risking prison | Genny Scherer,"I’m standing up with protesters to draw attention to this crisis – I can’t watch while fellow citizens die because of our filthy air, says anti-pollution activist Genny Scherer","For more than 50 years I have loved living in London: but I am now more and more worried about the pollution. I’m worried about the pollution in the water, the pollution in the ground, and the pollution in the air from the busy arterial roads and airports. It’s affecting me and it will affect the crops on my allotment. I have a bike, but in order to go out on a bike now I have to wear a mask which, with my asthma, makes it difficult. When I was arrested last week for spraying “air pollution is criminal” on City Hall, the mayor of London’s office, I was singing “maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner” – I don’t believe Londoners should have to suffer these conditions any longer.
I am taking visible action, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now
People need to be made aware of the issues of air pollution and climate change and start communicating with each other about them. I’m taking this visible action because I want to give people something to talk about; we are calling on the mayor to sit down with community groups and discuss solutions to air pollution. There are already thousands of people in this country and across the world standing up to say now is the time to act on the climate. I am standing up with them, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now.
Along with other clean air defenders, we sprayed “air pollution is criminal” on the walls of City Hall five times last week and were arrested every time. At the police station, the police officers were respectful to us in spite of clearly being overworked and understaffed. In some cases there was even genuine understanding of our action for clean air, even if they did not approve of the methods.
Taking action in the way we did, a kind of “art drama” politics, is a rollercoaster of emotions. Part of me says why bother, why not just enjoy the rest of my life, but my awareness of the danger and future damage won’t let me. I have not given up on provoking people to act on what is happening, to work to cut air pollution and avert climate breakdown. For instance, so far a dozen London community groups have started working in coalition to put increasing pressure on Sadiq Khan to take urgent action. The London Coalition for Clean Air is holding an open introductory meeting on 17 April and I hope that more people and groups will get involved with it. If that happens, then our actions last week will have been worth it.
The mayor should be providing ways for people to get involved and excited about fixing our air pollution crisis – something that is so crucial to the health of all citizens. Money needs to be used to spur people to be creative around technology and to change our cities so we have room for all people to move through them without these deadly health risks. Room for disabled people, room for cyclists, space for people who go slow or fast. I want to see lots of trees, and every house using alternative energy, with plants growing everywhere. Open the parks, don’t close them.
We must get rid of pollution. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground. We need an urgent transition; we should all be demanding it and encouraging others to do so too, whether that is through acts of protest, writing to our politicians or talking to our neighbours. This pollution is causing more than 9,000 Londoners to die prematurely every year. Stop killing Londoners.

Mass unemployment, totalitarianism, war: a repeat of these horrors is to be avoided at all costs. Eighty years after Neville Chamberlain agreed to Hitler’s demands over the Sudetenland, there is still no greater insult than to dub a politician an “appeaser”.
The determination in policy circles to avoid a return to the 30s helps explain why up until now it has never happened. Central banks slashed interest rates and turned on the electronic printing presses a decade ago because they feared a second Great Depression. Welfare states are more generous than they were when John Steinbeck was writing The Grapes of Wrath. Decades of growth have made societies wealthier; advances in medical science have made them healthier.
That said, the world is currently closer to a return to the 30s than it has ever been. The echoes are loud and getting louder.
Let’s start with the obvious. As it did in the period between the two world wars, something has gone seriously wrong with the global economy. The story of the past 20 years has been that of an unsustainable boom followed by a deep recession and the weakest recovery in history.
Central banks have applauded themselves for preventing Great Depression 2.0, but what they never admit is that they did so by creating asset bubbles. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing – the bond-buying process that boosts the supply of money – led to a speculative frenzy for commodities, shares and property. Those bubbles are now starting to pop. Oil prices are crashing, house prices are flat, shares on Wall Street are on course to have their worst December since 1931.
In the 1920s and early 30s, there was a reluctance to give up on a conservative model of political economy: the gold standard, balanced budgets, a limited role for government and a belief that markets would deliver the best of all possible outcomes if left unhindered. Eventually, stark evidence of failure forced a rethink. Starting with Britain, countries came off the gold standard. Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. John Maynard Keynes explained why it was possible for unemployment to remain high. The economic problems of the 20s had prevented the full flowering of the technologies that appeared in the first few decades of the 20th century. It required a paradigm shift to full employment, capital controls and a fairer division of the spoils for that to happen.
No such reassessment has taken place since the global economy’s near-death experience of a decade ago. Governments are supposed to balance their budgets, money is free to go where it will, the banking system remains largely untouched, and the imbalance of power between capital and labour remains unaddressed. Growth has only been possible because of a buildup of debt. This proved unsustainable in the past and will do so again.
To make matters worse, the distribution of income and wealth has mirrored that of the period between the wars. Real wages – adjusted for inflation – have barely risen for those on low and middle incomes; such growth as there has been has been snaffled by the better off. If you own a home or own shares, the past decade has been good for you. If you are in a low-wage job with only modest savings, life has not been nearly so comfortable.
All these factors – economic underperformance, the return to business as usual and the sense that we are not all in this together – have given rise to a different sort of politics: nationalistic, populist and angry. People in the 30s were susceptible to the cult of the strongman leader because parties of the centre-left and centre-right seemed impotent in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by the Wall Street crash. Now that cult – Putin in Russia; Modi in India; Erdoğan in Turkey; Trump in the US; Bolsonaro in Brazil – is back and for the same reason. Voters are no longer convinced that mainstream politics can deliver.
Protectionism is back, and, although Trump’s trade war with China is so far more of a trade skirmish, the direction of travel is clear. “America first” is the modern-day equivalent of US isolationism in the 20s and 30s. Governments that pledge to look after their own – through tariffs or immigration controls – have tapped into a genuine sense of unease about how the fruits of globalisation have been divvied up.
The 40s and 50s saw the creation of a network of multilateral organisations designed to prevent a return to the beggar-thy-neighbour world of the 30s and to embed the new social democratic order. These institutions – the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (conceived in the 1940s but created decades later) and the European Union – have all to a greater or lesser extent been captured by neoliberal ideology and by big business interests. Faith in international cooperation has frayed.
One seeming difference between the 2010s and the 1930s is the absence of an ideological clash. During the Great Depression, there were plenty of people in the west who saw Stalin’s five-year plans as a credible alternative to free-market capitalism. That struggle ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of the market to parts of the world where it had previously been off limits.
In fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth; on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet.
Britain’s fixation with Brexit means it is easy to portray Theresa May as Chamberlain and to see the prime minister’s recent abortive trip to the EU summit as her Munich. This, though, misses the bigger picture. Brexit is not the most important issue facing the world; it is not even the most important issue facing Britain.
Governments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. They understand that time is not on their side. Yet at the UN summit in Poland they came up with an agreement they knew was inadequate to meet the challenge.
Katowice was the real Munich and the feeble UN accord the equivalent of the piece of paper Chamberlain brought back home with him from his meeting with Hitler. Appeasement doesn’t work and merely delays necessary policy action. That was true in the late 30s and it is true again today. Ultimately, policymakers have a choice. They can put their economies on an environmental war footing or they can continue to bottle it. In the 30s, they acted in time, but only just. For today’s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh.

This was not just because exhausted delegates were glad to go home after negotiations that dragged on 30 hours beyond the deadline. It also reflected the harder miles and tougher battles to come over the next two years if the planet is to remain habitable.
Scientist after scientist told the conference that the decisions made by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after which the already apparent dangers of climate instability become far worse.
The toughest decisions, however, were pushed into the future, to a special climate summit next September called by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the next two COP conferences – in Chile in December 2019, and then to the country chosen to host in 2020.
Katowice showed that the multilateral system of global decision-making is still alive, but under growing threat from fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund.
Decision-making at the UN is painstakingly difficult at the best of times, because it requires a consensus among 195 nations. In Poland, 14,000 delegates took two weeks to debate the latest science and proposed policy instruments as they whittled down more than 2,800 areas of disagreement.
The result was a new global rulebook on emissions that requires nations to report every two years on their progress towardParis agreement commitments to keep temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C.
Several past obstacles were overcome. China accepted standards on transparency, and richer nations – particularly Germany and Norway – put their hands deeper into their pockets to provide more than $100bn (£80bn) to help poorer nations adapt. A renewed division between the developed and developing world did not materialise as feared.
But more fundamental obstructions also came more sharply into focus. The malign role of fossil fuel interests has often been hidden in bureaucratic language or lost in the distractions of diplomatic spats, but in Katowice there were several moments of blinding clarity. Chief among them was the alignment of the world’s top three oil-producing nations – the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia – to downplay scientific warnings about temperature rises beyond 1.5C. Soon after, an ambassador from Australia – a major coal exporter – joined Trump administration officials in a panel that promoted carbon fuels. Brazil was also accused of holding up talks with a highly contested carbon-accounting proposal that could have reshaped how emissions from the Amazon are calculated. The country’s diplomats denied this but the issue has been kicked forward and it is unlikely the incoming nationalist president Jair Bolsonaro will make life easier for the negotiations.
There was also more clarity as a result of the recent protests in France, which prompted policymakers to think twice about the social implications of higher fuel prices. The leading energy economists Nicholas Stern and Ottmar Edenhofer said carbon taxes were still an important instrument to nudge economies away from fossil fuels, but that the transition has to be fair as well as fast, which means using the extra tax revenue for green infrastructure or redistributing it among poorer members of society who are often hardest hit by fuel tax rises.
Tensions will grow along with the stakes, as will frustration at the widening gap between the science and politics. More protests and lawsuits can be expected from climate litigation groups, financial divestment activists and a growing number of direct action campaigners, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and striking students such as Greta Thunberg. They, along with many scientists, say it is not enough to agree on rulebooks. After delaying action for so long, they argue the world now needs leaps rather than steps.
All of which suggests the next two years will be among the most fraught and crucial in the history of humanity. Investment decisions on power stations and infrastructure taken during this period will determine whether carbon emissions can be cut by the 45% needed by 2030 to give the 1.5C target a chance.
It would be fitting if the UK won the right to host the crucial climate summit in 2020. Done well, it would showcase how the world’s first industrialised nation is shifting away from carbon faster than almost any other. Done badly, the UK – by then probably outside the EU – will highlight the folly of shifting away away from multilateralism just when when the world needs to pull together.",745,2.898550724637681e-4,0.15391304347826087,0.05536231884057972,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,0.03217391304347826,0.643768115942029,0.058260869565217394,2.898550724637681e-4,0.05536231884057972

That’s true, but it doesn’t lessen EPA’s authority","Donald Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accepts that humans are causing global warming and we need to take action to stop it. The problem is that he doesn’t trust the experts at EPA to do so and wants to erode their authority to regulate carbon pollution.
When discussing Chevron and climate change, we usually focus on the company’s legal liability. However, in Kavanaugh’s context, ‘Chevron deference’ is even more important. The term refers to the fact that courts will generally defer to government agency interpretations of laws as long as Congress hasn’t spoken directly to the issue at hand.
David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council noted that Kavanaugh doesn’t believe Chevron deference applies on issues of major importance. In a recent net neutrality case, Kavanaugh argued, “While the Chevron doctrine allows an agency to rely on statutory ambiguity to issue ordinary rules, the major rules doctrine prevents an agency from relying on statutory ambiguity to issue major rules.”
That’s Kavanaugh’s position on climate change. In oral arguments before his DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 Clean Power Plan case, Kavanaugh said:
This is huge case … it has huge economic and political significance … it’s fundamentally transforming an industry by telling existing units you in essence have to pay a penalty, a huge financial penalty in order to continue to exist, in order to shift from coal plants to solar and wind plants, at the same time the coal mining industry is in essence greatly harmed, as well.
But while regulating carbon pollution would have a major impact on the fossil fuel industry, the same is true of most pollutant regulations. It’s nevertheless EPA’s job to regulate pollutants, and the agency has been doing exactly that since its inception.
In the 2016 oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that the Clean Air Act is “a thin statute, it wasn’t designed with [greenhouse gases and climate change] specifically in mind.” But EPA was created to address various types of pollution, and the Clean Air Act gave it that legal authority. As the Act’s text notes:
the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in mounting dangers to the public health and welfare
The Clean Air act also defined the term “air pollutant” very broadly to allow EPA the flexibility to regulate any new sources of pollution that the agency might identify in the future:
The term “air pollutant” means any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material, special nuclear material, and byproduct material) substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.
And it gave the EPA Administrator the authority to regulate any pollutants that threaten public health and welfare:
For the purpose of establishing national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, the Administrator shall within 30 days after December 31, 1970, publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant … emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare
The Clean Air Act even envisioned EPA’s regulatory authority extending to impacts on the climate:
All language referring to effects on welfare includes, but is not limited to, effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate…
In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court affirmed that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants, and EPA therefore has authority to regulate them if the agency determines that they may endanger public health or welfare. In its 2009 Endangerment Finding, that was indeed EPA’s conclusion:
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare .... The major assessments by the U.S. Global Climate Research Program (USGCRP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Research Council (NRC) serve as the primary scientific basis supporting the Administrator’s endangerment finding.
In a key 2014 case Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 that EPA can continue to treat greenhouse gases as pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act and can apply those regulations to power plants. Justices Scalia, Roberts, and Kennedy joined the majority decision. The good news is that Scalia’s position in this case was modeled after a prior Kavanaugh opinion.
But generally speaking, Kavanaugh doesn’t trust the EPA experts to regulate carbon pollution.
In the 2016 oral arguments before his court, Kavanaugh laid out his case for why Congress, not the EPA should tackle climate change:
Earth is warming, and humans are contributing, and I understand the international collective action problem here, I understand that very well, and I understand the frustration with Congress, I live that, too, everyone understands that. But under our system of separation of powers, and this is why it’s so important that we maintain that, Congress is supposed to make the decision. You might say, you know, this Congress is not going to, they’re not going to do anything, but that’s not how we get to make decisions … for a big question like this Congress can do things like job training programs, and community college assistance, and welfare assistance, and drug programs for the people who are out of work, and that becomes more of a problem, that’s why the separation of powers principle matters, because Congress can look at something like this in a well-rounded approach, and that was the difficulty obviously that happened in the Senate. But for us to do it, for you to do it, all the people who are left behind are just left behind.
Kavanaugh is right that Congress could and should do a better job tackling carbon pollution than EPA. For example, Hillary Clinton developed plans to both tackle climate change and help coal communities adapt. But Republicans in the White House and Congress are owned by the fossil fuel industry, and thus unwilling to advance serious climate legislation.
However, the fact that Congress won’t act as long as Republicans are in charge doesn’t lessen EPA’s authority to regulate carbon pollution. Kavanaugh’s unwillingness to defer to EPA’s legal authority is wrong. The Clean Air Act is very clear that EPA should regulate pollutants that may endanger public health and welfare, and greenhouse gases certainly qualify.
If Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court, he’ll join the other conservative justices in eroding EPA’s ability to regulate carbon pollution. EPA won’t take serious action until there’s a Democrat in the White House anyway; nor will Congress act unless Democrats are in charge of that branch of government.

But while America’s traditional allies and environmental groups continue to urge Trump to stay within the Paris deal – in which nearly 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperatures to a 2C (3.6F) increase on the pre-industrial era – the actions of the US president, most recently at the G7 meeting in Sicily, have begun to provoke murmurs that perhaps the world would be better without American involvement.
The final G7 communique saw the US unusually break with the other six nations by failing to commit itself to the Paris agreement, which Trump promised to “cancel” during the presidential campaign, and reports on Wednesday claimed he had decided to exit. The exasperation of European leaders suggested they are ready to move on with or without the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
“The whole discussion about climate has been difficult, or rather very unsatisfactory,” said German chancellor Angela Merkel. “Here we have the situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.”
The US formally turning its back on perhaps the last best chance of a coordinated response to climate change would certainly carry heft. Frantic calculations by several thinkthanks and universities have estimated that US withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year, raising the global temperature by 0.1C (0.2F) to 0.3C (0.5F) by the end of the century.
Such a regression would be compounded if other countries took the United States’ lead and also decided to quit Paris, or at least not strive to fill the void in emissions reduction. This would have grave implications for coastal cities facing sea-level rise, parts of the world already blighted by heatwaves and food insecurity, and the planet’s endangered species.
While US emissions would start to level off rather than continue their gradual decline, there are signs that India and China, the two other national heavy hitters in emissions, are moving away from coal more quickly than expected, according to Climate Action Tracker.
This has led several economists and large US businesses to fret that the coming boom in solar, wind and other renewable energies will not take place in the US. China signaled its intent earlier this year by announcing it will invest $360bn in renewable energy by 2020, creating more than 13m jobs in the sector.
If the economic fallout of leaving the Paris deal does not sway Trump, the diplomatic and security ramifications may. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, has urged the US to “keep a seat at the table” in order to maintain its international standing, while UN secretary-general António Guterres has raised the possibility of “risks of conflict” if climate change is not properly addressed.
If Trump does decide to stay in the deal, it is likely he will attempt to “renegotiate” it, which would mainly involve the US revising down its goal of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. Opponents of the deal, such as Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, have framed Paris as a “bad deal” for the US that may even hinder Trump’s domestic agenda of winding back various environmental regulations.
Several independent legal experts, as well as those who helped craft the Paris agreement, reject this view, pointing out that the edifice is built on a series of voluntary non-binding goals submitted by countries. Paris is essentially a statement of intent, a signal from governments to their citizens and businesses that low-carbon economies are on the way and that this inevitability should be financially supported.
Some supporters of Paris are now wondering how useful it would be to have a disengaged US within such a structure. The American public is largely in favour of the Paris deal and could be given the misleading impression that their government is addressing the climate issue by simply staying put, despite tearing down Barack Obama’s climate policies such as the clean power plan at the same time.
 “Wanting the US to remain is a short-sighted, knee-jerk reaction,” said Luke Kemp, an expert in international environmental policy at the Australian National University. “The international community should be much more worried about the real domestic actions of the US, rather than whether it is symbolically cooperating internationally.”
Kemp points out that the US could act as a drag upon the international climate effort if it doesn’t leave. “The US and the Trump administration can do more damage inside the agreement than outside it,” he said.
 The momentum is reportedly with the “leave” faction, with a group of 22 Republican senators – minus the notable voices of Lindsey Graham and John McCain, who want the US to remain – urging Trump to make a “clean break” from Paris. On Tuesday, Trump again met with Pruitt, one of the most vociferous opponents of the deal.
 But the White House’s confusion over the decision and its wider ramifications was perhaps summed up best by Sean Spicer, Trump’s spokesman, who on Tuesday was asked the simple question of whether Trump believed global warming was spurred by human activity, a subject he has previously vacillated upon. 
“Honestly, I haven’t asked him,” Spicer replied. “I can get back to you.”",896,0.00985576923076923,0.12524038461538461,2.403846153846154e-4,2.403846153846154e-4,0.00985576923076923,2.403846153846154e-4,0.505048076923077,2.403846153846154e-4,0.3487980769230769,2.403846153846154e-4

Now we can calculate how much | Myles Allen and Peter C Frumhoff,It is possible for scientific evidence to help apportion responsibility for climate damages among fossil fuel producers. Our paper shows how,"As communities in coastal Texas and Louisiana confront the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey, another hurricane, Irma, fueled by abnormally warm waters, is barreling into the Caribbean and threatening Puerto Rico and Florida.
We know that the costs of both hurricanes will be enormous and that climate change will have made them far larger than they would have been otherwise. How much larger? Careful studies will take time but the evidence that climate change is warming ocean waters, increasing both sea level and the risk of extreme precipitation in these regions is well established.
On 29 October 2012, when Hurricane Sandy slammed into America’s east coast, a storm surge of more than nine feet caused extensive flooding damage throughout the affected region. Researchers have since determined that the damage from that storm surge was greatly worsened by climate change.
Sea level along the East Coast has risen by about eight inches since 1900, as oceans have warmed and expanded in response to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, with subsiding land adding insult to injury. According to one study, sea level rise increased Sandy’s flood damages to property in New York City alone by $2bn – more than $230 per New Yorker.
More than six percent of the rise in global sea level resulted from emissions traced to ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP
Such costs from storm damage attributable to climate change are just one piece of the story. New York City estimates that it will spend an estimated $19.5bn to prepare for climate change impacts through 2030. And researchers say developing countries most vulnerable to rising seas and increasing extreme weather will need between $140bn and $300bn annually by 2030 to help them cope.
Who should pay these costs? In the United States, the default assumption is that costs of climate damages and adaptation should be borne by taxpayers, through flood insurance programs, federal disaster relief funds and the like, as well as by affected individuals, families and private businesses.
This assumption is now being challenged in the courts. Lawsuits filed in July by three coastal California communities against ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and other large fossil fuel companies argue that the companies, not taxpayers and residents, should bear the cost of damages from rising seas.
They draw on extensive evidence that fossil fuel companies, knowing that their products contributed substantially to climate change, engaged for decades in a coordinated campaign to publicly disparage climate science to avoid limits on emissions.
These lawsuits build on a vigorous and growing debate in the court of public opinion and among company shareholders about the responsibilities of fossil fuel giants for their contributions to climate change.
This is a debate fueled by high-profile evidence of some companies’ deception, the growing and devastating human and economic costs of climate change, and the recognition that even today fossil fuel companies maintain business models that assume the continued global reliance on their products that would drive heat-trapping emissions and temperatures well above the Paris agreement limits that some of the same companies profess to support.
Today, we and several colleagues are publishing a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Climatic Change that shows it is possible for scientific evidence to help apportion responsibility for climate damages among fossil fuel producers.
Using a simple, well-established climate model, our study for the first time quantifies the amount of sea level rise and increase in global surface temperatures that can be traced to the emissions from specific fossil fuel companies.
Strikingly, nearly 30% of the rise in global sea level between 1880 and 2010 resulted from emissions traced to the 90 largest carbon producers. Emissions traced to the 20 companies named in California communities’ lawsuits contributed 10% of global sea level rise over the same period. More than 6% of the rise in global sea level resulted from emissions traced to ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, the three largest contributors.
We have the data needed to link the emissions traced to products sold by a fossil fuel company to a specific share of changes in temperature and sea level rise. Determining who should pay what for climate damages is a social and political question. But this kind of scientific work can help inform public and policy debate over the issue and potentially offers an approach that can help juries and judges to monetize damages in cases like the California communities’ lawsuits.
Plainly, companies should not be at liberty to persist for decades in selling products as safe to use when they know they are harmful and have alternatives available to them. Upon learning of the risks of their products, companies could have used their considerable technical and financial resources to greatly accelerate carbon storage and clean energy technologies.
Many, even within the fossil fuel industry itself, are arguing they can still change course, but it is hard to justify the immediate cost to shareholders when just using the atmosphere as a waste dump and leaving impacted communities, taxpayers and future generations to deal with the consequences appears to be a risk-free alternative. But, as we found in the 2008 financial crisis, allowing companies to make private profits while society at large underwrites the risk ends badly for everyone.
It may take tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to support disaster relief and recovery among Gulf coast communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP have collectively pledged only $2.75m.
As scientists further identify the role that climate change has made to exacerbating this tragedy, courts of law and public opinion should judge whether they are paying their fair share.",917,0.34710920770877945,0.12441113490364027,0.2057815845824411,2.1413276231263385e-4,2.1413276231263385e-4,0.1843683083511777,0.019486081370449677,2.1413276231263385e-4,0.11370449678800856,0.004496788008565311

At the current rate, the world’s oceans will be on average at least 60cm (2ft) higher by the end of the century, according to research published in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.
Based on 25 years of satellite data, however, the research shows that the pace has quickened. It confirms scientists’ computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the UN, which releases regular climate change reports.
“It’s a big deal” because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said the lead author, Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado.
Other scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. “Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,” said Katy Serafin, a coastal flooding expert at Oregon State University.
Sea level rise is causing by warming waters and the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Of the 7.5cm rise in the past 25 years, about 55% is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice.
The process is accelerating, however, and more than three-quarters of the acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.
There are two factors that affect sea level rise: year-to-year fluctuations caused by natural events and larger long-term trends linked to man-made climate change. Nerem’s team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption that temporarily chilled the planet, and the climate phenomena El Niño and La Niña, and found the accelerating trend.
Sea level rise rather than temperature is a better gauge of climate change in action, according to Anny Cazenave, the director of Earth science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research.
Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century, when they rose increasingly quickly because of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels, said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute in Germany.

Canavan told Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones on Friday he had never been to Paris, and was “happy to leave the Champs-Élysées for others”, but people needed to be clear the treaty Tony Abbott committed Australia to in 2015 “doesn’t actually bind us to anything in particular”.
Abbott said in 2015, when he announced Australia would be signing up, that the government was making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030 and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”.
But Canavan said on Friday the Paris commitment was a three-page document that allowed Australia flexibility to build new coal plants. The resources minister said rather than focusing on the situation in 2030, “what I want to focus on is solving the crisis we have in energy today”.
“We have to build power stations. There’s nothing in the [Paris] agreement that would stop us building power stations, including coal-fired power stations,” Canavan said.
“We need new ones”.
Canavan said Queensland was “propping up” New South Wales with the newest coal fleet in the country.
Jones prefaced his interview with Canavan with a long condemnation of the new foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the decision to sign on to a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum this week nominating climate change as the single greatest security threat to the Pacific.
The communique said all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
Jones declared the prime minister, Scott Morrison, needed to “recall Marise Payne and replace her”. He said the Morrison government would have no hope of winning the next federal election if it wanted to “persist with the global warming rubbish and the Paris agreement”.
The 2GB host said Paris needed to be “ripped up”.
“Do you want to win an election or don’t you?” Jones said to Canavan on Friday morning.
Canavan dead-batted. “Of course I want to win the election, Alan. But, more importantly, what I want to do is have good policies for Australia and make our country strong”.
The Queensland Nationals have been campaigning for months for government backing for new coal plants.
In his first major speech in the energy portfolio, the new minister, Angus Taylor, signalled he wanted to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities.
Taylor said the government was intent on boosting supply, and that meant expanding existing plants, upgrading ageing “legacy” generators, as well as pursuing new “greenfield” projects.
Taylor is currently working up options for cabinet.
A recent forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator predicted 30% of Australia’s coal generators will approach the end of their technical life over the next two decades, and it said it was important to avoid premature departures if the looming transition in the national energy market is to be orderly.
But it was also clear that the most economical replacement for the ageing coal fleet was not new coal, but “a portfolio of utility-scale renewable generation, storage, distributed energy resources, flexible thermal capacity, and transmission”.
Aemo concluded that mix of generation could produce 90 terawatt hours of energy per annum, “more than offsetting the energy lost from retiring coal-fired generation”.",550,3.5842293906810036e-4,0.2906810035842294,3.5842293906810036e-4,0.003942652329749104,0.6025089605734767,3.5842293906810036e-4,0.1007168458781362,3.5842293906810036e-4,3.5842293906810036e-4,3.5842293906810036e-4

Unlike most general elections or byelections where economic management, tax, health and education dominate voters’ thinking and candidates’ pitches, the byelection in Wentworth will be a referendum on climate change and the lurch to the right by the Liberal party.
The Liberals have done much themselves to make climate the central issue – and not in a good way.
The dumping of their national energy guarantee, inextricably linked with the dumping of the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, from his job as prime minister, which ultimately triggered his resignation and Saturday’s poll, exposed the great schism within the Liberal party on this issue.
It has left the Liberal candidate Dave Sharma with little to say other than that he believes climate change is real and that Australia is on track to meet its Paris commitments. But has has offered no detail on how, other than to point to Snowy Hydro 2.0, a project close to his predecessor’s heart.
The Neg also laid bare the deep fissures in the Coalition between the pragmatic centre and the right wing, which Turnbull tried to bridge for three years but in vain.
The well-educated voters of Wentworth, who might once have felt reassured that Turnbull would prevail, now see that the party that they have supported for 60 years is not the moderate “small l” Liberal party they voted for. 
Wentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year
Add in a drought in Australia, record-breaking storms in the US and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning that the world faces a catastrophe without urgent action on climate change to peg global warming to 1.5%, and it’s no wonder the issue has become, perhaps, the defining factor in the Wentworth byelection.
GetUp’s climate campaigner, Miriam Lyons, says it’s not just Wentworth; climate change is now as big an issue as it was in the 2007 election campaign.
That does not bode well for the Coalition at the next election.
Converting that unhappiness over climate change into a vote for someone else has been the subject of an intense, co-ordinated campaign in Wentworth.
A coalition of environmental groups has been working together in the electorate to ensure that voters realise they have an opportunity to send a message on climate change.
The ScoMos, with lumps of coal, and the Tony Abbotts in their budgie smugglers outside candidate events are just the most visible parts of their efforts.
GetUp has organised an army of phone banking volunteers who have called more than 85,000 of Wentworth’s 103,000 registered voters.
“After the IPCC report came out and Scott Morrison said it didn’t apply to Australia, one man walked into our office and said: ‘what can I do?’. He’s one of our phone banking volunteers now,” Lyons says.
Over the past few days, volunteers have swelled to more than 100 each night.
GetUp will have literally hundreds of volunteers at polling places handing out cards that explain how to cast your vote for the environment. It gives four options: Greens, the independents Kerryn Phelps and Licia Heath, and Labor.
But in a controversial move, it has changed the Greens’ recommendation on preferences, instead advocating a preference for Phelps ahead of Labor’s Tim Murray.
The former Greens leader Bob Brown has also recommended putting Phelps ahead of Murray after voting 1 Greens, in a pragmatic recognition that there is a greater chance of the Liberals being defeated if she comes ahead of Murray.
Lyons says GetUp’s decision on who to recommend and how to preference is based on candidate responses to surveys and a scoring process that evaluates each candidate on their promises on climate policy, and other progressive issues such as ending offshore detention. Phelps has said she opposes the giant Adani mine, while the ALP supports it, although Murray has said he will work to halt it.
Several green groups also organised a candidate forum at Bondi Pavilion, which was attended by 300 people. But it received good national exposure, thanks to speakers from the conservative side of politics – John Hewson and Geoff Cousins, who were joined by coral expert Professor Terry Hughes.
Hewson, a former Liberal leader, has urged voters concerned with climate change to vote against the Liberals.
“The idea was to maximise turnout by getting more conservative voices to lead with the message: ‘its OK to put climate change as the top priority in deciding how to vote’,” says Gavan McFadzean, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s (ACF) climate campaigner.
Hewson’s intervention seems to have been a turning point, aided by Malcolm Turnbull’s son, Alex Turnbull, who has used his Twitter account and media interviews to advocate for a protest vote against the party his father once led.
He says he’s doing it because climate change is the most important issue, and while he appears to have acted off his own bat, it has certainly helped underline the climate policy void on the conservative side of politics.
The ACF does not issue how-to-vote cards, but has sent its 5,000 supporters in Wentworth a scorecard rating each candidate on their environmental policies and has asked them to talk to their friends and family about the issues.
The advertising has also been more conventional, and the ACF has been running advertisements about climate change and drought in local cinemas, while GetUp has crowd-sourced funds for mobile billboards that have become regular features on the streets of Wentworth.
The ACF has also produced electorate-specific data on what climate change will mean for that community. It plans to replicate the work, by the Australian National University, for more electorates during the the general election.
Wentworth is proving a useful test bed for strategies the environmental groups plan to use next year.
“Wentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year,” McFadzean says. “The main challenge will be to keep climate as an issue through the UN Conference of Parties meeting in Poland and into next year.”",1009,2.1691973969631238e-4,2.1691973969631238e-4,2.1691973969631238e-4,0.04577006507592191,0.6379609544468547,0.002386117136659436,0.0631236442516269,0.09349240780911063,0.013232104121475054,0.14338394793926246

But at a climate summit in California last month he found himself pitching one. In partnership with the company Blue Planet, he was demonstrating a low-tech-looking machine that can pull carbon dioxide from the air and store it in construction materials.
If every new building for the next 30 years was made with the resulting product, humans could erase the globe-warming pollution they’ve sent into the atmosphere, said Fiekowsky, founder of the Healthy Climate Alliance network.
Blue Planet’s technology is nascent in a scene dominated by a few companies that specialize in carbon removal, and it won’t be the last newcomer.
People have done too much damage to the climate to avoid catastrophe just by halting the burning of fossil fuels. They now will have to re-engineer the world, according to scientists with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The livability of the planet will thus depend largely on tools that are now available only on a small scale and currently still expensive.
The key, Fiekowsky said, is not the technology itself. It’s having a meaningful goal: restoring the climate, “because it means maybe we’re not doomed”.
The UN’s recent report – which says it will require unprecedented action within the next 12 years to keep temperatures from climbing beyond a current 1C increase to a 1.5C increase – does not inspire optimism in many carbon removal experts.
While it’s technically feasible to slow fossil fuel use fast enough and capture enough greenhouse gases to limit warming, the world is not on track to do so.
Scaling up carbon capture technology is possible but will be difficult, said Kurt Waltzer, managing director for the Clean Air Task Force.
“We are absolutely going to have to have a significant amount of carbon removal, there’s no question about it,” Waltzer said. “The level will probably depend on how quickly we can get to a zero-carbon world, but it is going to be enormous.”
Most of the work has previously centered around sequestering carbon from power plants, which is different than drawing it from the air.
James Mulligan, carbon removal expert at World Resources Institute, said direct-air carbon capture technologies are “unproven at the scale that we’ll need them”. A decade ago, they were viewed as “impossibly expensive”, he said. Now, some are touting a cost of $100 to $200 per ton of carbon.
“That’s still expensive,” Mulligan said. “But halting climate change isn’t going to be free.”
Reforestation and new agricultural practices could also trap carbon and help slow warming. But direct removal will still be necessary.
With direct-air capture, the most obvious option is to store carbon underground. But technologies that create a sellable product will help reduce costs. Three of the biggest direct-air carbon removal companies – Carbon Engineering, Climeworks and Global Thermostat – are all working to store CO2 in something useable.
Carbon Engineering markets a carbon-neutral fuel. Climeworks sends carbon to fertilizers, fuels and soon, the beverage industry. Global Thermostat sells the gas for a wide range of purposes.
Products made with carbon don’t demand a high enough price to boost capture around the world, so expanding them will require government intervention.
Louise Charles, a spokeswoman for Climeworks, said the company has found government support in Europe and has 14 direct-air capture plants built or under construction. But she said there just isn’t enough money in the industry yet. Next year, Climeworks will enter a new market, letting individuals pay to catch and store carbon to account for their own emissions from flying and driving.
Steve Oldham, the CEO of Carbon Engineering, said interest in his company has increased in the last few weeks in light of the IPCC report, which he said may be good for business but is overall “kind of scary”.
“We think we have a solution that could be part of solving the problem,” Oldham said. “But the missing piece in the middle is policy, and policy requires both need and a solution.”",650,0.0036065573770491808,0.6495081967213114,0.09213114754098362,0.0036065573770491808,3.278688524590164e-4,0.10852459016393443,0.059344262295081975,3.278688524590164e-4,3.278688524590164e-4,0.08229508196721312

But the idea is controversial","Despite recent heavy rains, Ethiopia is still reeling from the worst drought to hit the country for half a century, particularly in the livestock-dependent regions of Oromia and Somali. Yet studies (pdf) suggest the country could have billions of cubic metres of untapped groundwater.
The story is the same across many parts of Africa, where farmers rely on erratic rains and depleted surface water while potentially vast groundwater reserves go ignored. Africa’s subterranean water amounts to an estimated 660,000 cubic kilometres (pdf), according to research from the British Geological Society – more than 100 times the continent’s annual renewable freshwater resources.
A new initiative co-led by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is aiming to mobilise support for greater use of Africa’s under-used aquifers. Developed in the wake of targets set at the UN Sustainable Development Summit and the Paris climate talks last year, the goals of the Groundwater Solutions Initiative for Policy and Practice (GRIPP) include leveraging $1bn (£770m) of investments in sub-Saharan Africa for sustainable groundwater irrigation and improving groundwater access in the region for 4m rural households.
The idea is timely given widespread drought across southern and eastern Africa, yet it is not without controversy. Decades of overexploitation in north Africa (pdf), where groundwater is more abundant, have left many sedimentary aquifers dangerously depleted and in some cases degraded by saltwater intrusion. In Morocco, for example, the water table of the Saïss deep aquifer – one of north Africa’s largest aquifers – has fallen by an annual average of 3m over the past 20 years.
If the right policies and incentives are in place, however, groundwater can be exploited sustainably, argues Jeremy Bird, director general of IWMI.
Not only is groundwater more locally available and more reliable than rain in many parts of Africa, says Bird, it also serves as a better buffer to climate shocks: “It provides an opportunity for farmers to move one step up the ladder from very uncertain rain-fed irrigation, which is subject to the vagaries of climate, to supplementary irrigation, which offers them the ability to provide water when the crop really needs it.”
Improving Africa’s irrigation infrastructure has long been a goal of national policymakers and development agencies. The World Bank, for instance, is currently trying to mobilise international funders to help double irrigation levels in six countries in the drought-prone Sahel region. 
The Sahel Irrigation Initiative Programme, with input from IWMI, is now considering the use of simple, farmer-managed pump bores alongside its focus on more expensive canals, reservoirs and other centrally-managed surface water infrastructure projects.
Vincent Casey, water, sanitation and hygiene senior adviser at WaterAid, however warns these simple pumps must be managed well: “Despite the advantages of convenience and affordability, the scale of pumping is very difficult to regulate which inevitably has economic consequences when groundwater is depleted.”
Africa may have considerable untapped aquifers, but not all are able to be easily and affordably accessed, says Casey. “Rural electrification has been limited, discounting the possibility of politically motivated energy subsidies that could make high powered pumping affordable to small scale farmers”. Capacity for groundwater withdrawal is also hampered by a lack of reliable hydro-geological data (Ethiopia has mapped less than one quarter of its groundwater resources) and relevant expertise. 
All these factors contribute to a patchy experience of groundwater projects to date. According to UPGro – a DFID-funded research programme examining groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa – nearly one third of such projects in sub-Saharan Africa fail within a few years of construction. The World Bank puts the estimated cost of groundwater project failures at more than $1.2bn (pdf) in lost investment over the last 20 years. 
The main aim of GRIPP, which is focusing on projects not just in Africa but around the world, is to correct this trend through the promotion of research and knowledge-sharing around sustainable groundwater withdrawal practices and policies.
A vital step in this respect centres on farmer buy-in, says Ugandan water planning expert Callist Tindimugaya, vice president of the International Association of Hydrologists, a GRIPP partner. Because groundwater is an “invisible commons”, he argues, farmers struggle to know what comprises sustainable usage. Government provision of cheap power for water pumps and other price incentives to promote agricultural productivity can lead to overuse as well, he adds.
“Local initiatives to co-manage the resource are increasingly being explored as an important element in sustainable groundwater use as farmers realise their common interest in safeguarding the resource,” says Tindimugaya. 
A case in point from another part of the world is in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where farmer groups in over 700 communities agreed to collectively monitor groundwater levels, to plan their crop planting jointly and to adopt water-saving techniques. The project, which ran from 2003 to 2009, successfully reduced overexploitation (pdf) in the semi-arid state. Since the project ended, however, and without adequate governance systems in place, most of the farmer-led initiatives have ceased.
Policymakers might find incentives the best initial defence against unsustainable abstraction, says Bird. He cites a pilot project in the Chinese province of Shanxi, where farmers access set volumes of water from the state-run pumping system with pre-paid smartcards. If they use less than their quota of pumping time, they can trade it with other farmers.
“Our role is to identify the types of policies which might work in a particular situation, learn lessons from other areas and then assess the impacts of these policy decisions over time and see what the implications have been,” says Bird.",905,0.006262626262626263,0.17595959595959595,0.06484848484848485,0.47898989898989897,2.0202020202020202e-4,0.10727272727272727,0.16585858585858584,2.0202020202020202e-4,2.0202020202020202e-4,2.0202020202020202e-4

The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado said the sea ice reached its summer low point on Saturday, extending 4.14m sq km (1.6m sq miles). That’s behind only the mark set in 2012, 3.39m sq km.
Center director Mark Serreze said this year’s level technically was 10,000 sq km less than 2007, but that’s so close the two years are essentially tied.
Even though this year didn’t set a record, “we have reinforced the overall downward trend. There is no evidence of recovery here,” Serreze said. “We’ve always known that the Arctic is going to be the early warning system for climate change. What we’ve seen this year is reinforcing that.”
This year’s minimum level is nearly 2.56m sq km smaller than the 1979 to 2000 average. That’s the size of Alaska and Texas combined.
“It’s a tremendous loss that we’re looking at here,” Serreze said.
It was an unusual year for sea ice in the Arctic, Serreze said. In the winter, levels were among their lowest ever for the cold season, but then there were more storms than usual over the Arctic during the summer. Those storms normally keep the Arctic cloudy and cooler, but that didn’t keep the sea ice from melting this year, he said.
“Summer weather patterns don’t matter as much as they used to, so we’re kind of entering a new regime,” Serreze said.
Serreze said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Arctic was essentially ice free in the summer by 2030, something that will affect international security.
“The trend is clear and ominous,” National Center for Atmospheric Research senior scientist Kevin Trenberth said in an email. “This is indeed why the polar bear is a poster child for human-induced climate change, but the effects are not just in the Arctic.”
One recent theory divides climate scientists: Melting sea ice in the Arctic may change the jet stream and weather further south, especially in winter.
“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said. “It looks increasingly likely that the dramatic decrease in Arctic sea ice is impacting weather in mid-latitudes and may be at least partly responsible for the more dramatic, persistent and damaging weather anomalies we’ve seen so many of in recent years.”",400,0.880327868852459,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4,0.11530054644808745,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4,5.46448087431694e-4

The fund was a key aspect of the Paris agreement signed in 2015, which aims to keep global warming “well below” 2C and aspires to keep warming to 1.5C.
Established in 2010, it is financed by wealthy countries and used to assist developing countries with adaptation and mitigation. It was widely seen as a key measure to bring both rich and poor countries to the negotiating table.
The US committed to transferring $3bn to the fund. The new instalment leaves $2bn owing, with the incoming president, Donald Trump, expected to cease any further payments.
The move followed a large campaign, with more than 100 organisations and nearly 100,000 people calling for Obama to transfer the full $2.5bn owed to the fund.
“The Obama administration is refusing to let president-elect Trump’s posse of oil barons and climate deniers dictate how the world responds to the climate crisis,” said Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, of Corporate Accountability International, which led the campaign.
“Tens of thousands of people around the world called on President Obama to step up before Trump takes the keys of our government and tries to reverse decades of climate progress,” she said. “This victory is the climate justice movement’s opening salvo to the Trump presidency. And we’re not going away.”

They’re suing five major oil companies (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP) to pay for the cities’ costs to cope with the sea level rise caused by global warming. Chevron’s lawyer presented the science for the defense, and most notably, began by explicitly accepting the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, saying:

For example, one brief filed by a group led by Christopher Monckton and Willie Soon began by stating, “The “consensus” about global warming is 0.3%, not 97%” (this is obviously incorrect). Another brief filed by William Happer, Steve Koonin, and Richard Lindzen argued that “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” Chevron and the IPCC disagree.
While it’s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry’s behalf.
The judge mandated that those submitting briefs detail their funding sources, and they listed a litany of oil companies and fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Among those listed by Monckton and Soon’s group were ExxonMobil, the Heartland Institute, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Among those listed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen were the Heritage Foundation, Peabody Coal, the Cato Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
It’s a perfect example of the oil industry’s two-faced behavior. For decades their own scientists quietly published peer-reviewed research concluding that humans are causing global warming. That was the face we saw from Chevron’s lawyer. But at the same time, oil companies were funding contrarian scientists and think tanks to spread denial and doubt about that same science. That was the face revealed in the denier briefs.
Although they accept the expert climate consensus, the oil companies obviously don’t want to be held liable for the costs of the climate damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating climate science uncertainties, Chevron’s lawyer noted that the IPCC states that climate change is caused “largely by economic and population growth,” not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry’s strategy is to argue that individual climate impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products. It’s eerily similar to an argument made by tobacco industry lawyers:
Those who decide to start smoking or continue smoking should assume responsibility for a choice they make -- because no one can say they don’t know about the dangers associated with smoking
In short, the industry lawyers argue that the consequences are the fault of smokers and energy consumers, not the companies producing the dangerous products.
That argument didn’t work for the tobacco industry in the past, because they knew of the health risks associated with consuming their products, yet engaged in campaign to manufacture doubt to convince people to keep smoking. Ultimately, a federal judge found the tobacco industry guilty of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of their products.
It’s a more difficult case to make against the oil industry because their scientists published climate research in peer-reviewed journals available to the public, and their campaign to manufacture doubt about human-caused climate change was waged through intermediaries. They funded think tanks to do their dirty work, as we saw in the denier briefs.
Tobacco industry executives continued publicly denying their own scientists’ findings to the very end, even under oath. 
The oil industry has modified the tobacco playbook by accepting the scientific consensus. And Chevron’s lawyer argued that as a complex global problem, any climate remedies should be addressed through government policy rather than via the legal system.
Since it effectively owns the Republican Party, Big Oil can afford to accept the science to avoid legal ramifications, without fearing any such legislative consequences unless the Democratic Party takes full control of the US government, which won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest. 
It’s a brilliant strategy, and until Democrats take power and pass a carbon tax or other similar climate legislation (or enough Republican lawmakers stop denying the science and start finding bipartisan policy solutions), it might just work. 
But even if they lose this lawsuit, at least the cities of San Francisco and Oakland forced the oil companies’ hand. In a high-profile case, they accepted the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. These companies have employed scientists researching climate change for four decades, and as the world’s biggest and most profitable producers of carbon-polluting products, have the strongest motivation to deny climate science. If even Big Oil accepts the reality of human-caused climate change when pressed in court, it’s difficult for anyone else to deny it from here forward.",905,2.1645021645021645e-4,2.1645021645021645e-4,0.11926406926406927,2.1645021645021645e-4,2.1645021645021645e-4,0.46774891774891775,0.002380952380952381,2.1645021645021645e-4,0.4093073593073593,2.1645021645021645e-4

The move emerged days after experts at Chatham House warned international oil companies they must transform their business or face a “short, brutal” end within 10 years.
Shell’s new division brings together its existing hydrogen, biofuels and electrical activities but will also be used as a base for a new drive into wind power, according to an internal announcement to company staff.
With $1.7bn of capital investment currently attached to it and annual capital expenditure of $200m, New Energies will be run alongside the Integrated Gas division under executive board member Maarten Wetselaar. 
Insiders said the group chief executive, Ben van Beurden, wants to ensure Shell is at the forefront of oil company innovation.
“He does not want to get out so far in front where he dilutes investor returns but he does want to make sure Shell is at the leading edge of transition [to lower-carbon economies].”
The Anglo-Dutch group may already be trailing Total of France, which already has its own New Energies division and boasts of being the world’s second-ranked solar energy operator through its affiliate SunPower, bought for £800m in 2011.
Shell has made no formal announcement so far about New Energies but the new business is expected to be revealed at a public strategy briefing in London on 7 June. 
Company insiders claimed Shell wants to play down the importance of New Energies for fear it will be written off as a “greenwash” exercise by environmentalists, but said the company believes the new business could become very big – although not for a decade or more.
It is unlikely Greenpeace and others will be impressed by New Energies, given that the division’s annual spending level is less than 1% of the total $30bn Shell pumps into oil and gas.
Van Beurden has not yet signalled a slowdown in the high-cost oil and gas investment that has made Shell a target of anti-fossil fuel campaigners, who believe such investments will only result in so-called stranded assets – carbon made unburnable by international commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Shell has pulled back from high-risk Arctic drilling but is still engaged in deepwater projects and in the high-CO2 Canadian tar sands – although it is trying to cut emissions by developing a carbon, capture and storage facility.
The Shell boss told investors at a company meeting in London last week he did expect oil and gas demand to continue strongly but the company also took its responsibilities to tackle global warming seriously. 
“The big challenge, both for society and for a company like Shell is how to provide much more energy, while at the same time significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions,” he said.
The following day Shell announced it was bidding in a partnership to build two windfarms off the Dutch coast that will be big enough to power 825,000 households. 
Shell already holds interests in nine other wind projects in North America and Europe, although spending on wind, solar and hydrogen projects was suspended by former chief executive Jeroen van der Veer in 2009. A substantial solar operation had been largely sold off three years before that.
Rival BP also promised to go “beyond petroleum” and established an Alternative Energy business with its own London headquarters and chief executive, only to gradually wind it down.
Paul Stevens, a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper that the oil majors were no longer fit for purpose – hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and wrongheaded strategies.
In the report, Stevens argued the only way forward for the companies lay in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers.
“The prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed … their old business model is dying,” said Stevens, a visiting professor at University College London.",655,0.009117647058823529,0.3414705882352941,0.5385294117647058,2.9411764705882356e-4,0.023823529411764705,2.9411764705882356e-4,0.023823529411764705,0.015,0.04735294117647059,2.9411764705882356e-4

The TCFD report – part of a G20 initiative led by governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney and former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg – outlines how companies should disclose climate-related information in their financial filings, with the aim of allowing economies to properly value climate-related risks. 
It recommends companies disclose all of their direct and and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and describe the risks and opportunities caused by climate change under a range of potential scenarios.
More than 100 businesses with over $2 trillion of combined annual revenue have publicly committed to adopting the voluntary recommendations.
The report follows a draft published in December 2016, for which the TCFD received hundreds of submissions from respondents in 30 countries.
“Climate change presents global markets with risks and opportunities that cannot be ignored, which is why a framework around climate-related disclosures is so important,” Bloomberg said in a statement. 
“The task force brings that framework to the table, helping investors evaluate the potential risks and rewards of a transition to a lower carbon economy.” 
The recommendations were intended to be adopted by all companies, however there was extra guidance given to the financial sector, as well sectors likely to be most affected by climate change or the transition to a lower carbon economy – energy, transportation, construction and agriculture, food, and forestry
“Widespread adoption will provide investors, banks and insurers with that information, helping minimise the risk that market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising,” Carney said in a statement. 
The TCFD, led by Bloomberg, was established at the COP21 in Paris by the Financial Sustainability Board (FSB). The FSB was created by the G20 in the aftermath of the 2007-08 global financial crisis and is chaired by Carney.
Christian Thimann, head of regulation sustainability at the insurer AXA and a member of the TCFD, said the financial sector had a particular interest in taking up the recommendations.
He said insurers like AXA had several reasons to adopt the voluntary code. “We of course have an intrinsic interest in the world fighting against climate change. We see the frequency and intensity of natural disasters linked to climate change augmenting every year,” he said.
“We consider a world of plus two degrees may still be insurable but a world of plus four degrees might not be.”
He said banks have a shorter outlook than insurers but have an important role in steering the entire economy: “They too can use these recommendations because they will need to steer their lending between sectors aligned with a 2-degree world and sectors not aligned. They need to know which are the sectors with a high risk of stranded assets in the future and those with a low risk of stranded assets in the future.”
Yeo Lian Sim, a special advisor to the Singapore Exchange and member of the TCFD said although the recommendations were made as a voluntary code for which there is a compelling business case to adopt, she thought they might one day become regulated for in some economies if they are widely adopted.
Over the next year, the TCFD would work to monitor and assist companies implementing their recommendations.
Philippe Defosses, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP and vice chair of the UK’s Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change said: “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement and to work on their own climate risk disclosure.”
“There should be no resistance to the widespread adoption on the TCFD’s recommendations given how – in most G20 countries – companies already have legal obligations to disclose material risks in their routine financial filings, including those that related to climate change,” Defosses said.
Emma Herd, chief executive of Australia and New Zealand’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors see climate change as a material financial risk and are calling on business to disclose their 2C strategy. 
“Boards need a plan for managing climate change risks and opportunities that shareholders can see. Having a globally consistent framework for reporting on material climate change risks will accelerate this trend,” she said.
Among the companies that publicly supported the recommendations were big miners and resource companies like BHP Billiton, Shell and Glencore; energy businesses like Engie Group; and major banks like HSBC, Bank of America and Citigroup.",751,2.785515320334262e-4,0.10055710306406686,0.6576601671309192,2.785515320334262e-4,0.01977715877437326,2.785515320334262e-4,0.21754874651810582,2.785515320334262e-4,2.785515320334262e-4,0.0030640668523676884

That gives us reason to hope","If you’re looking for good news on the climate front, don’t look to the Antarctic. Last week’s spate of studies documenting that its melt rates had tripled is precisely the kind of data that underscores the almost impossible urgency of the moment.
And don’t look to Washington DC, where the unlikely survival of the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, continues to prove the political power of the fossil fuel industry. It’s as if he’s on a reality show where the premise is to see how much petty corruption one man can get away with.
But from somewhat less likely quarters, there’s been reason this month for hope – reason, at least, to think that the basic trajectory of the world away from coal and gas and oil is firmly under way.
At the Vatican, the pope faced down a conference full of oil industry executives – the basic argument that fossil fuel reserves must be kept underground has apparently percolated to the top of the world’s biggest organization.
And from Wall Street came welcome word that market perceptions haven’t really changed: even in the age of Trump, the fossil fuel industry has gone from the world’s surest bet to an increasingly challenged enterprise. Researchers at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis minced no words: “In the past several years, oil industry financial statements have revealed significant signs of strain: Profits have dropped, cash flow is down, balance sheets are deteriorating and capital spending is falling. The stock market has recognized the sector’s overall weakness, punishing oil and gas shares over the past five years even as the market as a whole has soared.”
The IEEFA report labeled the industry “weaker than it has been in decades” and laid out its basic frailties, the first of which is paradoxical. Fracking has produced a sudden surge of gas and oil into the market, lowering prices – which means many older investments (Canada’s tar sands, for instance) no longer make economic sense. Fossil fuel has been transformed into a pure commodity business, and since the margins on fracking are narrow at best, its financial performance has been woeful. The IEEFA describes investors as “shell-shocked” by poor returns.
And the third problem for the fossil fuel industry? That would be the climate movement
The second weakness is more obvious: the sudden rise of a competitor that seems able to deliver the same product – energy – with cheaper, cleaner, better technologies. Tesla, sure – but Volkswagen, having come clean about the dirtiness of diesel, is going to spend $84bn on electric drivetrains. China seems bent on converting its entire bus fleet to electric power. Every week seems to bring a new record-low price for clean energy: the most recent being a Nevada solar plant clocking in at 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour, even with Trump’s tariffs on Chinese panels.
And the third problem for the fossil fuel industry? According to IEEFA, that would be the climate movement – a material financial risk to oil and gas companies. “In addition to traditional lobbying and direct-action campaigns, climate activists have joined with an increasingly diverse set of allies – particularly the indigenous-rights movement – to put financial pressure on oil and gas companies through divestment campaigns, corporate accountability efforts, and targeting of banks and financial institutions. These campaigns threaten not only to undercut financing for particular projects, but also to raise financing costs for oil and gas companies across the board.”
Hey, the movement against Kinder Morgan’s pipeline got so big, the Canadian government had to literally buy the thing in order to try and ram it through. Protesters will die, a former Bank of Canada governor predicted this week – though he added the country will have to muster the “fortitude” to kill them and get the pipeline built.
For activists, the best part of the IEEFA report is a series of recommendations for precisely how to hurt the industry the most, from creating delays that “turn a marginal project into a cancelled one” to “strategic litigation” to “changing the narrative”.
The report’s authors write: “The financial world is just beginning to understand the fundamental weakness of the fossil fuel sector, and barely acknowledges the global climate movement’s growing power and reach. This has created a powerful opportunity to develop and foster a new storyline on Wall Street: that the oil and gas industry is an unstable financial partner just as it faces its greatest test.”
That’s work we’re capable of. If a few years of campaigning is enough to convince the pope we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, a few more quarters might finally persuade the suits that there’s more money to be made elsewhere. But speed is clearly of the essence. If massive losses of money loom over Wall Street, massive losses of polar ice loom over us all.

For nine years the Community Interest Company has run all its vehicles on waste cooking oil from local restaurants, recycled into biodiesel, but now it wants to go one step further.
The Big Lemon wants to install solar panels on the roof of its east Brighton depot, storing the energy in batteries and charging buses overnight. It is working with the Brighton Energy Cooperative (BEC) towards a vision of zero emissions bus services in every UK community by 2030, using Brighton as a pilot.
The Big Lemon eventually wants to replace its 10 biodiesel buses, which are not suitable for conversion, and has already raised £250,000 of investment in a bond issue to do this, exceeding the original target of £100,000.
The company has also been shortlisted for the M&amp;S Energy Community Energy Fund, which could bring up to £25,000 through a public vote and pledged donations from voters – the cost of the solar panel installation at the depot. The project is currently leading votes in the south and more than £9,490 has been pledged.
Although this is the first UK initiative of its kind, there are examples of electric buses across the country, including in London and Harrogate. The government has put £30m of funding towards helping bus operators and local authorities in England run more low-emission buses.
“Electric bus technology has progressed quite far. We wanted to try that and embrace it,” says Tom Druitt, managing director of The Big Lemon. Biodiesel has a low carbon footprint but there are still emissions from the buses. Using electricity means almost no emissions.
The key thing about The Big Lemon idea is that the energy will be generated on site. “If we run on mains electricity then we still have a large carbon footprint,” says Druitt, who is also a Green party councillor.
The Big Lemon has decided to convert diesel buses to run on electric, instead of buying brand new electric buses. Work has begun on the first buses which were purchased for £20,000 each. With conversion costs of £140,000 each, Druitt says this approach is still cost effective as, depending on the brand, a new electric bus would cost between £250,000 and £500,000. Conversion also allows the company to have more say in the bus’s specifications.
Druitt estimates that The Big Lemon will save around £20,000 a year in fuel costs, as well as a reduction in maintenance costs. “We’ve estimated that there’s a six-year payback on these buses and we’re calculating for an eight-year life span, so essentially we get two years free,” he explains.
The panels for the initial project will generate 30,000kWh of electricity and will power the whole of the 52 route between Woodingdean and Brighton city centre. The Big Lemon wants to power all five of its routes this way eventually while its coach fleet, used for longer distances, will continue to use waste cooking oil due to a lack of available technology.
How easy will this idea be to replicate elsewhere? Chris Jardine, technical director of solar energy experts Joju Solar, says that in theory it should be easy. “I think the intricacies will be in whether you can get enough energy from the solar to fully power the fleet,” he says. “It may be easy in summer, while in the middle of winter you might be getting five times less electricity out of your solar panels.
“By not putting it into the grid it makes it a bit more difficult as you come across this commonly found issue with renewables, that they’re intermittent,” says Will Cottrell, chairman of BEC. “You need to think quite hard about how it works technically,” he adds, explaining that getting the right size battery and overall system is key to providing the right level of supply.
“But this is the way it’s got to be,” he says. “To move us away from a centralised energy system we need to move away from a centralised grid as well, so we need to understand the technology that is going to enable us to do that.”
The plan for The Big Lemon is to produce enough energy in the winter, and an excess in summer but it will have a mains backup if needed. The team can then use any excess energy in the summer to give energy to the building. 
“I think our independence, background and philosophy generally makes it easier for us to try these things,” says Druitt. “That’s what all our stakeholders signed up for really, we don’t have an angry mob in an AGM.”",768,0.0033434650455927053,0.4167173252279635,0.4288753799392097,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.006382978723404256,3.0395136778115504e-4,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.05805471124620061,3.0395136778115504e-4,0.08541033434650457

After a decent spring in the north-west and a dazzling late summer in the south-east, garden buddleias remained bereft. The only butterfly I’ve seen in good number is the red admiral, which thrived during the second-warmest September on record.
The scientific numbers are not yet in from the UK Butterfly Monitoring scheme (a magnificent dataset collected by 2,000 volunteers each summer which celebrates its 40th birthday this year) but the Big Butterfly Count recorded its worst figures since it began – worse than the washout of 2012.
“Because the summer weather wasn’t anything like as bad as 2012, the finger is pointing at the mild, wet winter,” says Matthew Oates of the National Trust.
Most of us probably don’t consider last winter an “extreme” event, but it was wet and violently mild. December 2015 was the warmest ever in the Met Office’s Central England Temperature series stretching back to 1659. It’s the most anomalous month ever recorded – 5.1C above average, more than double the ordinary monthly average.
We may have barely noticed last December, but butterflies did. Caterpillars emerged from their diapause, found nothing to eat and perished.
“The interesting thing is the species that did worst this summer are generally those that spend the winter as larvae,” says Oates: the purple emperor, silver-washed fritillary and white admiral all struggled this year.
We need more scientific research on the impact of mild, wet winters, but such correlations are fiendishly difficult to prove. “It’s scary,” says Oates of the mysterious impact of extreme weather.
Small children won’t be the only ones wishing for snow this winter. Butterfly lovers will be too.

Just like last year’s sorry excuse for a debate on taxation reform, where nation building policy ideas were knocked off the table one by one, we find our federal government again unable to act in the national interest when it comes to energy policy.
Unlike the tax debate, there is at least a broad acknowledgement of a problem. Across the nation we are witnessing coal mines close, power bills increase and a collapse in investment for new energy generation. With that in mind, you would think even the biggest supporters of the coal industry, the Turnbull government, could not accept the status quo. The national energy market is failing and now, when a credible solution is put forward the discussion is shut down by the prime minister.
In the absence of a coherent national policy on low carbon energy, state governments including South Australia are being blamed for pursuing ambitious renewable energy targets. What South Australia has done over the last decade is take advantage of its natural advantages to secure investment in cheap clean renewable energy. This leadership has received accolades from clean energy pioneers including Al Gore and Malcolm Turnbull.
My state has been described as the “canary in the coal mine” on energy policy – an ironic description when you consider the fact that our state’s last coal-fired power station shut its doors earlier this year. September’s statewide blackout, which was caused by tornados ripping transmission lines out of the ground, was falsely blamed on renewable energy by those in the pockets of the coal lobby. What these anti-renewable opportunists did achieve was to put the issue of a failing national energy market on the agenda.
A national emissions intensity trading scheme has now been proposed as a mechanism to stimulate investment in our energy market. It provides the transition plan that is needed towards the lowest cost, most reliable and cleanest energy system.
The CSIRO, Australian Energy Market Commission, business groups and the government’s own chief scientist believe this is an idea worthy of consideration at the very least. But before Alan Finkel’s report had even been delivered to Coag, the prime minister dropped the idea like a piping hot double espresso.
A national energy market needs a national solution. That is something we can all agree on. But if, like the tax debate, we are left with nothing on the table then the states will be forced consider their options. If this means designing and implementing our own scheme, then this should also be considered.
Many Australians were optimistic that Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership would provide us with sensible policy debate and action in the national interest. After this week’s events, any remaining optimism has now evaporated.

At 5.05pm in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday 10 April, there was no indication that it would. No Englishman had won the Masters, arguably golf’s most coveted individual event, since 1996. The American Jordan Spieth, who held a five-stroke lead, was in the midst of an extraordinary run, spanning 12 months. Step forward Danny Willett, who seized an opportunity in the most emphatic way.
Then 28, Willett had enjoyed a decent professional career without scaling great heights. The Yorkshireman had played in the Masters only once before, when he tied in 38th place out of 97. But as Spieth stumbled, it was Willett who breezed to the summit of the leaderboard, with a closing round of 67 that took the title by the relatively comfortable margin of three shots.
Just 12 days earlier, Willett’s wife had given birth to the couple’s first child, Zach. “I always said I wouldn’t come here if Zach wasn’t born by now,” Willett said. “Fortunately, he listened to my prayers and came early. It’s just been the most ridiculously awesome 12 days.” Ewan Murray
New rule: from 2017 onwards, no referendums. Because it always ends in misery. Brexit proved that, but the ballad of Boaty McBoatface proved it harder. The Natural Environment Research Council was about to unveil a new £200m polar research vessel, and asked the public to name it. The public – or at least the LOLsy, internet-dwelling slice of the population that Instagrams coffeeshop blackboards – decided to name it Boaty McBoatface. In the end, Boaty McBoatface gained 124,000 votes, four times as many as its nearest rival, and the vessel’s fate looked set.
But then it didn’t, because science minister Jo Johnson decided the whole thing was silly. He named it the RSS Sir David Attenborough, hoping that aligning the craft with our greatest national treasure would calm everyone down. When that didn’t work, he promised to name one of the ship’s remotely controlled submersibles Boaty McBoatface instead, but it was too little too late.
Still, this wasn’t the end. Boaty McBoatface is a folk hero now. He is Robin Hood. He is Wat Tyler. Whenever there’s an injustice in the world, we will point our ears towards the wind and hear the words “Boaty McBoatface”. Stuart Heritage
When the pope visited Lesbos in April, he returned with three families. At first they lived in a refuge run by the Sant’Egidio charity; now the three families have paperwork, a titolo di viaggio allowing free travel in Europe, and homes of their own. “It’s what I dreamed of,” says Nour Essa, 31, who lives with her husband Hasan and son Riad in a two-room flat in Rome’s city centre. Bringing up a two-year-old in shared quarters had been a strain, and made Nour feel she couldn’t parent as she chose. Today, Riad attends nursery and is starting to talk. “We speak only Arabic to him,” Nour says. “He replies to us only in Italian.” A new life comes more easily to children.
Are they happier now? “We are better, but we feel homeless,” Nour says. “Your studies, all your efforts, are thrown away because you must initiate a new life. You are like a child.” She studied microbiology for five years in Damascus and two years postgraduate in France; in Italy she must start again from the third year of an undergraduate degree. Hasan, a garden designer, must study architecture before he can practise in Italy; he attends university in Rome.
The second family, Suhila Ayiad and Ramy Alshakarji, live alongside a community of nuns. Suhila is learning Italian; their 16-year-old son thrives and wants to study dentistry, while their 18-year-old is “living the teenage years he couldn’t live in Syria”, a Sant’Egidio spokesperson says diplomatically. Little Quds, Ramy and Suhila’s youngest, is at school.
The third family, Osama Qawqaji and Wafa Eid, live a long way south of the charity’s language school. If they integrate, it will be through their children, the spokesperson says. “Probably they are planning to go back to Syria when they can.” Paula Cocozza
To the terrible date of 15 April 1989, when 96 people died and hundreds more were injured and traumatised at an FA Cup semi-final, the bereaved Hillsborough families finally succeeded in adding 26 April 2016 as a historic landmark: the day the truth about the disaster was finally, legally established. Fully 27 years from the day their loved ones died, they crowded into the converted courtroom on a Warrington business park, all that suffering compressed into an awful wait for a jury to answer yes, or no, to 14 questions.
Questions six and seven were the heart of the matter, deciders in the families’ and survivors’ implacable struggle against the lies of South Yorkshire police, whose officers had organised a campaign to blame the victims, even as people were dying at the football ground. In 1991, South Yorkshire police made that case relentlessly at the first inquest, claiming the people who had paid to attend the event in an expectation of safety had drunk too much and somehow been recklessly too eager to watch the match. The families had to pay for their own legal representation; they could collectively afford £142,000 for a single barrister, pitted against the battery of publicly funded police lawyers, and the jury verdict was accidental death. This time, Theresa May’s Home Office provided funding for two rows of forensic and persistently combative lawyers to oppose the same allegations made again by the police.
This adversarial rerun of the old, already discredited police stories stretched the new inquests to two years, the longest case ever heard by a jury in British history. It had been agony for the families, forced to revisit every detail of the day their lives were devastated.
Finally, verdict day arrived. The forewoman of the jury answered questions one to five as expected, agreeing that there were appalling safety deficiencies in Sheffield Wednesday’s squalid Leppings Lane away end. Then came question six: were the 96 people unlawfully killed due to criminal gross negligence by the police officer in charge, Ch Supt David Duckenfield? “Yes,” the forewoman agreed, calmly, and the families’ years of struggle came to be vindicated. Next, question seven, key to whether this day would deliver justice or be another terrible chapter: did the behaviour of Liverpool supporters contribute to the dangerous situation? “No,” the forewoman said, with a kind note in her voice. The reaction was a gleeful outpouring of relief. People cheered, wept, hugged each other. For so many bleak years, this had been unthinkable, and now it really had come to pass: the lies had been overhauled by the truth.Outside, blinking, disbelieving, with film crews and photographers in front of them, a group of family members instinctively started to sing the Liverpool club anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. Ian Burke was 17 when his father, Henry, a builder, was among the 96 who died so needlessly, leaving bereft another son, daughter and a grief-stricken wife. Ian had taken time off work to sit through almost every day of the inquests; quiet, racked with stress. Just days before the verdicts, aged only 44, he had a heart attack.He is still suffering heart-related health problems, yet look at the film or photographs of the group outside the court on 26 April 2016, and there he is in the middle, with his suit and tie on, arm aloft, singing the beloved song, and smiling.

You wouldn’t have dared suggest it as a Hollywood script: too unlikely. The unfashionable football, a toe-poke from relegation the previous season, 5,000-1 outsiders to win it this time round, goes on to beat the moneyed glory boys to the Premier League title. Impossible. You’d have got better odds on Piers Morgan being named Arsenal manager (2,500-1, since you asked). Yet it did happen. Leicester City’s the name, romance is the game.
And not just any old romance. Romance in the most cynical, spendthrift league in the world, where Manchester City regularly spend £40m on defenders who can’t defend, Manchester United sell Paul Pogba for nothing (and later resign him for £89m without a blink), and Chelsea sack two managers a week for fun. And here was little Leicester City, a raggle-taggle army of rejects, has-beens and unknowns, managed by an elderly Italian nicknamed the Tinkerman because he was so indecisive, winning the league title.
They didn’t even inch their way to the premiership, they blew their rivals away, winning 23 games, losing only three and finishing 10 points clear of their closest rivals, Arsenal. Jamie Vardy, who had been playing non-league football for Fleetwood Town three years earlier, scored 24 goals and won a place in the England team; little known Riyad Mahrez won player of the year; thirtysomething has-been Robert Huth (long since rejected by Chelsea) forged a mighty partnership with thirtysomething never-been Wes Morgan (who had spent 10 years at Nottingham Forest and ran tattoo parlours on the side).
To say Leicester were penniless is untrue; all Premier League teams have money. But to put it in context, their squad cost £52.8m, just over one 10th of Manchester City’s.
After Christmas 2015, the impossible became ever more probable. By March, it was a likelihood, by April an inevitability, and on 2 May they were crowned champions. The city was painted blue: foreign film crews embedded themselves in the East Midlands and taught themselves how to pronounce Leicester; literary bigwigs such as Julian Barnes waxed poetic about their favourite club; and Gary Lineker promised to present Match Of The Day in his smalls (he did).
Order has been restored since those heady days. As I write, Leicester (with virtually the same team) are 14th in the league, four points off the relegation zone, with three wins and seven defeats. But it was wonderful while it lasted. Simon Hattenstone
 “This is our Obama moment,” said Aisha from Tooting the day after the capital elected Sadiq Khan as mayor. For many other Londoners, it was the triumph of hope over fear, following an ugly campaign waged by Khan’s chief rival, Zac Goldsmith.
In a year characterised by the electoral gains of people and parties associated with the right, racism, xenophobia and nationalism, Khan’s decisive victory in May was a sweet, bright moment for those on the flipside of an increasingly binary political landscape. The contest was principally between Khan, the Muslim son of a bus driver and seamstress who grew up on a council estate with seven siblings, and Goldsmith, the son of a billionaire businessman and Eton alumnus.
On the advice of Conservative strategists, Goldsmith sought to portray Khan as a friend of Islamic extremists. The Tory candidate said Khan had “given platforms and oxygen and cover and excuses” to extremists. “London would be safer if I’m mayor,” he told voters.
Khan, meanwhile, celebrated the capital’s diversity. “I am a Londoner, I am European, I am British, I am English, I am of Islamic faith, of Asian origin, of Pakistani heritage, a dad, a husband,” he told voters, adding: “We do not just tolerate each other in London; we respect each other.”
When the votes were counted, Khan had the support of 57% of Londoners, compared with 43% who voted for Goldsmith. With around 1.3m votes, Khan also had the biggest personal mandate of any politician in UK history. Harriet Sherwood
 At 10pm on a Sunday in May, Jacob Husley was setting up at London nightclub Fabric for his weekly house and techno night WetYourSelf! when he passed an elderly couple on the stairs: “They were walking down slowly and she was on crutches. I asked, ‘Are you OK?’ but they just smiled and kept going.” Husley, 36, who has DJed at Fabric for eight years, checked with security, who said the couple had turned up with tickets.
Husley went back in to find them at the bar. They were Polish and didn’t speak English. “I wanted to offer them a drink,” he says. “They had tequila shots and I thought, ‘This couple are wicked!’ But I still had a feeling there was a mistake.”
As the club filled up, Husley took them to the VIP lounge and when a Polish friend arrived, he had him translate. “They said they’d always dreamed of going to one of the big, great nightclubs in London.” They’d bought tickets online in Poland and were staying with their niece in London. Husley offered them another drink and when they asked for tea, fetched some from a cafe down the street.
Other guests embraced the first-time visitors. “They didn’t stay in the VIP area. He kept venturing out to the dancefloor and everyone was giving him lots of attention. She sat by the bar and couldn’t dance, but people were saying hello. They definitely enjoyed themselves.” At 5am, they took Husley up on his offer of a taxi home.
The next day, Husley put a photo of the couple on Facebook. It went viral. “I think it inspired people,” he says. “They posted to their friends, ‘This is us when we’re old.’” The story got international coverage, but Husley didn’t know the couple’s names and had no way of contacting them.
Then, a few weeks later, he received a letter from pensioners Wladyslaw Nykiel, 82, and Stanislawa Zapasnik, 79. Nykiel wrote: “We had a wonderful time dancing with young Londoners who welcomed us very warmly. There are no words to describe the atmosphere and great fun [of Fabric].”
When Islington council closed Fabric in September, Husley got back in touch. Nykiel sent a picture of him and Zapasnik holding a #savefabric placard. Fabric will now reopen on 6 January – and Husley has made sure the couple have tickets. Candice Pires
Two years ago, most of England was asleep, something that hit me every time I travelled there from Scotland. In the summer of 2014, people north of the border were in the midst of their referendum, and life was full of talk about what was at stake. I’d immerse myself in the hurly-burly, then fly home to a country that felt sedated, where politicians still spoke in lukewarm platitudes.
Now look. In the wake of the EU referendum, politics in England and Wales is crackling with life. I travel around the country for the Guardian, and getting people to talk used to be like pulling teeth. Now, I mention the EU, Theresa May or Trump and off the conversation goes: people are awake.
This is not all on the pro-Brexit side, by any means. Remainers are starting to find their voices, too. New cross-party “progressive” groups have sprung up in Brighton, London and East Anglia, set on opposing the vision shared by the Tories and Ukip. In November, the Green party had the sense to stand down in the Richmond Park byelection, with the aim of kicking out the pro-Brexit Tory “independent” Zac Goldsmith, thereby playing its part in his defeat.
A new group, More United, is raising money for candidates from “the progressive centre”, pledged to a pro-European, egalitarian future. Meanwhile, the pressure group Compass, which began inside the Labour party, then reached beyond it, is to start making the case against old-fashioned party divides and in favour of what it calls progressive alliances. As well as the Greens’ co-leader Caroline Lucas, a handful of the most forward-thinking Labour MPs are giving it quiet support.
If the next few years are going to see a big thrashing out of what England is, the process will not be the preserve of the right. Old politics (the endless talk of “hard-working families”, “going forward” and the rest) is pretty much finished. That’s a good thing. And if what has replaced it is proving visceral and primary-coloured, there are voices on the left who can meet that challenge. Of course it will be difficult; the word “struggle” is part of the progressive vocabulary for a reason. But isn’t it better to be awake than complacently snoozing? John Harris
On 15 January, Peake performed the first British spacewalk outside the International Space Station, an event that took a dramatic turn when his colleague Tim Kopra’s helmet began to fill with water. Peake had to take the lead and bring the other astronaut back to safety from the outer panels of the space station. He did this with the calmness they seem to breed in the bones of astronauts; they appear to be chosen these days not just for their ability to perform in ludicrously demanding environments, but to smile and enthusiastically explain things to awestruck children while doing it.
For six months, until he came back down to Earth in June, Peake did just that, his heavily scheduled days split between experiments and outreach. He sent videos to schools; ran a London Marathon in orbit; he got people in Britain excited.
And that, in the end, was the point. Peake was not the first British astronaut in space; that honour belongs to Helen Sharman, who spent a week on the Mir space station in 1991, and there have been five Britons on space shuttle missions (though they had to take US citizenship). But Peake was the first astronaut whose trip was directly funded by the British government, through the European Space Agency. Where our financial commitment to a pan-European body lies now, post-Brexit, remains to be seen. But for a few months there was a man from Chichester in space, and you just ask a nearby eight-year-old how cool that is. Dara Ó Briain
As the world contemplates the calamitous prospect of Donald Trump unravelling the landmark Paris climate agreement, we should take comfort in the fact that another international accord has begun remedying one of our biggest environmental messes.
Scientists reported this year that the ozone hole above Antarctica, ripped open by our use of a group of chemical compounds, has started healing – good news that is the fruit of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This was when countries agreed the deal to first freeze and later phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), mostly in aerosols and refrigeration. Because the ozone layer protects us from ultraviolet light, the UN estimates the CFC phase-out has avoided 2m annual cases of skin cancer.
The hole has not vanished: it still opens from September to November, only more slowly. Experts believe there is still a way to go. But “by 2060 you’ll have almost no years with an ozone hole”, said Susan Solomon, who led the study published in Science magazine. “Maybe one in every 15 years, but it won’t be every year – bang, bang, bang – like it has been since the mid-80s.”
For Solomon, the healing of the hole is proof that the world can come together to tackle big environmental problems. “We made a mistake, and countries were willing to put their shoulders to the wheel and figure out how to fix it, and we did.”
The Montreal Protocol did have unintended consequences: the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that largely replaced CFCs contribute to climate change, too. In October, 170 countries met in Uganda and reached a deal to fix that. Under the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, HFCs will also ultimately be phased out, which some estimates say could avoid up to 0.5C of global warming. US secretary of state John Kerry hailed the deal as “a monumental step forward”. Adam Vaughan

She decided to go anyway,"Sylvia Wilson drove around Australia in an electric car. It cost her $150.90.
Wilson, 70, a retired farmer from near Biloela in central Queensland, had planned the trip of a lifetime with her husband, Rod. One impulsive evening in mid-2016 they went online and, sight-unseen, bought a Tesla S75 electric car for the journey.
A few months after Rod died last year, Sylvia announced to her family: “I think I’ll do that trip.
“Most of them were really keen. A couple of them said ‘you’re mad, you’ll never do it’,” Wilson told Guardian Australia.
It took Sylvia 110 days and 20,396km door to door to navigate the Round Australia Electric Vehicle Superhighway – a loop of charging stations. She is the first woman to drive the route and the second person to loop the country in a Tesla.
Her daughters, sisters, friends and a daughter-in law – in total seven different women – flew in and out from various points to keep her company along the way.
“I had to stick to a schedule because they had to book their flights, so there was no mucking around. I was flying blind to a certain extent. I booked all my accommodation, and that had to be tied in to what the car could do,” Wilson said.
My husband would have been tickled at how successful the trip was
Some of the more remote charging stations had never been used until Wilson rolled into town in Bluey, her affectionate name for the Tesla.
In the Kimberley, at Fitzroy Crossing, she arrived late on Friday afternoon and discovered the charging station not working.
“They found the only electrician in town and he came and did something and it worked,” she said.
At the next town over, Halls Creek, the power socket was at a business that was shut. At the local motel she found a 15amp power supply and was able to plug in overnight.
“They call it range anxiety. That’s what everyone talks about. It’s totally valid to have that, to be thinking about the next charge, once you’ve got an [electric vehicle].
“But the reality is that if you can see the lights on, or that the kettle works, then you can charge. Even in the remotest places you can still charge the car. In a way there are more places to charge an EV [electric vehicle] than there are a fossil fuel car.”
Sylvia recalls the night in mid-2016 when her husband Rod sat down beside her at the computer. By 9pm, they’d bought the Tesla.
Three months later, it turned up at their cattle farm, between Biloela and Gladstone, on the back of a truck.
“My husband and I, in the old days, disagreed on a lot of things,” Wilson said. “I was the greenie, he was the brownie. As he got older, I must have won I think. He became very concerned about the mess that we’re making of our little globe.
“He just started to take on board things like buying an electric car. I live off the grid here [with solar power] and charge the car off grid too. I couldn’t do those things without him wanting to do those things, too.
“He never drove it. He had Parkinson’s and he had a few problems because of that. It kind of amazed him that it was electric.
“I think he would have been tickled at how successful the trip was.”
Having the experience of driving around Australia – and fulfilling the dream she and Rod had planned – was only part of Sylvia’s motivation.
“My other purpose was to prove a point,” she said. “These are good cars and you’re not stuck to just going down to the shops.“The concern about the environment was front and centre. These cars are bloody expensive. But once you’ve paid for the car, your running costs are bugger all.”
The same trip would have, conservatively and based on city prices, cost more than $3,000 in petrol in a conventional sedan. Charging the car cost $150.90 in total, partly because people often did not want payment.
“Motel people and others who just let me charge and said ‘don’t worry about paying, off you go’. They treat it like a laptop or a phone.”
Wilson is recognised by 350.org in a report released on Wednesday as one of the “heroes building Australia’s low-carbon economy”. The report recognises investors, business leaders and everyday Australians whose private efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading the way as the federal government backs away from the Paris agreement targets.The chief execuitve of 350.org Australia, Blair Palese, said people such as Wilson were filling a climate change “leadership void” that had been vacated by politicians.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

 The submerged islands were part of the Solomon Islands, an archipelago that over the last two decades has seen annual sea levels rise as much as 10mm (0.4in), according to research published in the May issue of the online journal Environmental Research Letters.
 The missing islands, ranging in size from 1 to 5 hectares (2.5-12.4 acres) were not inhabited by humans.
 But six other islands had large swaths of land washed into the sea and on two of those, entire villages were destroyed and people forced to relocate, the researchers found.
 One was Nuatambu island, home to 25 families, which has lost 11 houses and half its inhabitable area since 2011, the research said.
 The study is the first that scientifically “confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people,” the researchers wrote in a separate commentary on an academic website.
 The scientists used aerial and satellite images dating back to 1947 of 33 islands, as well as traditional knowledge and radiocarbon dating of trees for their findings.
The Solomon Islands, a nation made up of hundreds of islands and with a population of about 640,000, lies about 1,000 miles north-east of Australia.
 The study raises questions about the role of government in relocation planning, said a Solomon Islands official.
 “This ultimately calls for support from development partners and international financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund,” Melchior Mataki, head of the Solomon Islands’ National Disaster Council, was quoted as saying in the commentary.
 The Green Climate Fund, part of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was founded to help countries deal with climate change.
In April, the Solomon Islands was among the 177 nations that signed a global agreement reached in Paris to curb climate change.
Ad hoc relocation has occurred on the islands, the study said. Several Nuatambu islanders moved to a neighbouring, higher volcanic island, the study said. Other people were forced to move from the island of Nararo.

The only other UN members not signed up are Nicaragua and Syria, which both chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place.
Their reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax.
Nicaragua declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua’s lead envoy to the Paris negotiations, told Climate Home: “We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure. We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.” 
The Bonn-based UN climate body has requested all countries in a position to do so to submit “intended nationally determined contributions” to international efforts to hold warming to 2C.
The following month, Oquist told Democracy Now: “Universal responsibility – everyone is responsible – is a spin on historical responsibility, because everyone didn’t create this problem.” 
Nicaragua’s share of global emissions (0.03%) pales beside that of the US (13.19%), yet it came fourth on a list of countries most affected by climate change between 1996 and 2015, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.
For its part, Syria has been mired in a civil war since 2011. The government of Bashar al-Assad has been heavily sanctioned by the UN over human rights violations, making it a pariah to much of the international community. 
The sanctions would have made it difficult for members of the Syrian government to travel to Paris to attend the discussions, and the ongoing conflict would have made it difficult for it to commit to any limitation of the country’s emissions. 
Nevertheless, other countries in the midst of conflict have signed up, including Yemen, as well other countries isolated by the international community, such as North Korea. Syria’s share of global emissions is also low compared with the US, at 0.14%.",354,0.09591836734693877,6.802721088435375e-4,6.802721088435375e-4,6.802721088435375e-4,6.802721088435375e-4,6.802721088435375e-4,0.6605442176870748,0.03469387755102041,0.12993197278911567,0.07551020408163266

Extinction Rebellion must succeed for their sake, says Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas","This afternoon an international sensation is taking to the stage in central London. She’s young, admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg. She’s a 16-year-old climate hero and I couldn’t be more proud to be co-hosting her visit.
Greta’s rise to fame has been vertiginous. Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change – and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe, which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge.
The success of the strike is not incidental. Every red light is flashing on the Earth’s dashboard. The 20 warmest years on record all happened in the last 22 years. Nature and wildlife populations are at crisis levels across the world. Wildfires and droughts are becoming increasingly common – with people in the global south already dying from the effects of climate change which were mostly caused by countries in the north. Here in the UK, communities are under serious threat from flooding, sea level rises, extreme heat and more.
Of course Greta had to act. And of course thousands followed her.
In the UK, Extinction Rebellion is also making waves. By putting their bodies on the line in protest against climate change, its members aren’t just creating headlines, they are showing moral courage at a time when too many politicians are taking us backwards. Greta arrives today in a country that talks the talk on climate, but simply won’t walk the walk. Not only are the government cheerleaders for dirty fossil fuels like fracking, but they’ve cut support for renewables like wind and solar. When we look back at this moment in a generation’s time, the real criminals won’t be seen as those blockading bridges – it will be those who understood the science of climate change, yet consistently blocked action to prevent its worst effects.
Yet despite government intransigence, there are real grounds for hope. We have the means to start to tackle this crisis – from renewable energy to clean and sustainable public transport. It is cheap and it is here; we just need to the political will to scale it up and roll it out, the first steps towards utterly transforming the global economy. And we need to take every step together, in a new, genuinely inclusive politics.
There is hope in a generation of people who are demanding from their leaders not just what seems politically possible but what is scientifically necessary to prevent total climate breakdown. That generation builds on longstanding struggles, particularly from environmental defenders who have risked – and given – their lives defending their land, water and rights against the power of fossil fuel firms who have stopped at nothing in their pursuit of the bottom line.
So when Greta takes to the stage today, she will see in front of her hundreds of people of her age who aren’t afraid to take a stand, and she will stand on the shoulders of the many environmental defenders who have stood before her.
Make no mistake, the climate movement has broken into the mainstream – and it is here to stay. Our task now is to meet every promise by a politician with a demand to go further, to scale up our ambition as those at the top seek to appease us with warm words and rousing rhetoric. We must be deadly serious about getting the work done to avoid the worst of this climate catastrophe.
If we don’t rise to this task,and don’t rise to it now, then we condemn Greta’s generation, and generations to follow, to a future framed by wildfire and drought – it’s as simple as that.

As humans add more heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, it causes the Earth to gain energy. Almost all of that energy ends up in the oceans. So, if you want to know how fast the Earth is warming, you have to measure how fast the oceans are heating up.
Sounds easy enough at first, but when we recognize that the oceans are vast (and deep) we can appreciate the difficulties. How can we get enough measurements, at enough locations, and enough depths, to measure the oceans’ temperatures? Not only that, but since climate change is a long-term trend, it means we have to measure ocean temperature changes over many years and decades. We really want to know how fast the oceans’ temperatures are changing over long durations.
But that isn’t all. Throughout the years, we have made changes to the measurement methods. From old canvas buckets that were dipped into waters which were then measured, to insulated buckets, to temperature probes on the hulls of ships, devices that would be dropped into deep ocean waters, and now the ARGO fleet, which is approximately 3,000 autonomous devices that are more-or-less equally distributed across the oceans. Each of these devices measures temperatures a little differently; they have biases. As you change from one set of instruments to another, you might see a cooling or warming effect related to the change in instruments, not because the water temperatures are changing. 
The seeming intractability of this problem is why I began studying it a few years ago. I have worked with colleagues to answer a very specific equation related to one of the most commonly employed ocean measurement devices, the eXpendable BathyThermograph (or XBT for short). For many years, these devices formed the backbone of ocean temperature measurements. My colleagues and I want to ensure measurements from XBTs are as accurate as possible.
These devices are used by navies to measure the depth of the thermocline. While that was their original mission, climate scientists have adopted the devices for determining long-term ocean temperature changes. The problem is that the devices are relatively simple; they are freely dropped into ocean waters. As they descend, like a spinning torpedo, they unwind a wire connected to a computer system on-board the ship. A sensor in the probe sends temperature information to the computer system and a recording is made. When the device expends its wire, the wire breaks and the device continues to fall until it impacts the ocean floor.
It’s important for scientists to know the depth of each temperature measurement that the probe makes. The problem is, the probe does not detect its depth. Rather, its depth is estimated by knowing how fast the probe falls in water. The probe weight is balanced by drag forced between the water and the device. If the knowledge of probe speed is not known accurately, it means a scientist may think the probe is at one depth when in fact, it’s at a different depth. This subtle uncertainty can lead to large uncertainties in the overall ocean heat content.
Extensive experiments have shown that our expectations of probe speed is suitable in areas where the ocean water is warm. But, what about Arctic regions? There, where water is cold, the water has a higher viscosity (and consequently drag force). We wanted to know whether we could correct that archive of ocean temperature measurements to account for measurements made in cold waters. To solve this problem, I teamed up with world-class scientists Dr. Lijing Cheng and Rebecca Cowley.
Lijing Cheng is a rapidly rising international scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is currently producing some of the best research on the Earth’s energy imbalance.
Rebecca Cowley is a data expert from CSIRO in Australia. Her group is recognized as among the best in ocean heat content measurements and data quality.
The article was just published by the American Society of Meteorology and can be found here. Our data shows that as you move from warm waters to cold waters, probe descent speed changes by approximately 2%. We provided a simple way that oceanographers could account for this effect in their data, and we then compared our proposed correction to high-quality temperature data obtained from side-by-side temperature experiments with two different instruments. We showed that our method reduces temperature error and increases our understanding of ocean warming.
I asked Rebecca Cowley for her perspective on this study and she said, 
We can see the effects of climate change in our oceans. To do this, we measure changes in temperature in our oceans over decadal time scales. Measuring the temperature of ocean water is not a new thing, it has been done for hundreds of years, and over time, measurement techniques have changed. In modern times, the XBT has been used extensively to measure ocean temperature and is only one of many methods. XBT data is special because it comprises ~50% of historical data between 1967 and 2001, a huge resource for oceanographers and for estimates of decadal changes in ocean temperature.
Small biases in the historical XBT data have been identified and various bias corrections have been developed which greatly improve the XBT data for climate change estimates. This work focusses on a purely physical method to estimate a fall rate for the XBT, which is unusual in the field of bias correction estimates. By looking at the physical shape of the XBT probe the fall rate is modelled. Other bias correction studies have looked at comparisons between XBTs and other instruments. 
When we apply fall rate bias corrections, we improve the historical XBT dataset (a massive resource), reduce the bias errors and give estimates of ocean warming that are more comparable to the results we see with other instrumentation. In turn, the XBT data becomes very useful as it fills the gaps in time where we have very few other instruments collecting ocean temperature data. The XBT data also becomes useful for global ocean models – the data is included in the models and it improves their accuracy. Improving the accuracy of our ocean models leads to better forward estimates of future climate change impacts.
Sometimes science isn’t sexy. Sometimes, you spend hours, days, and weeks to create small improvements in data. But at the end of the day, these small improvements add up. Being able to say we made things better is one of the reasons we got into science in the first place.",1078,0.12318548387096774,2.0161290322580645e-4,0.02036290322580645,2.0161290322580645e-4,2.0161290322580645e-4,0.8368951612903226,2.0161290322580645e-4,2.0161290322580645e-4,2.0161290322580645e-4,0.018346774193548385

Artificial intelligence, migration and a healthier old age mean countries no longer needed booming populations to hold their own, she points out. We would like to emphasise the major benefit, briefly pointed out in your article, that having one fewer child reduces a parent’s carbon footprint by 58 tonnes of CO2 a year. In fact, the most important contribution of a reduced birth is its long-term contribution towards mitigating global warming by reducing CO2 emissions. One major challenge to reducing worldwide CO2 emissions is the large variation between nations: 45 tonnes per capita per year in Qatar, compared with 16.5 in the US, 7.5 in China, 6.5 in the UK, 6.4 in the EU, 1.8 in Indonesia, and 0.3 in least developed countries, according to UN classification.
Reducing global carbon emissions while the developing world industrialises will require both convergence toward rates achieved in the most efficient industrialised countries and a global reduction in these rates, a strategy that the IPCC called “converge and contract”. But this strategy, with realistic levels of contraction, appears to fall far short of what is needed, especially with the recent recognition that the previous goal reducing global warming to 2C is insufficient to avoid major adverse impacts. It is here that population decline from falling birthrates can play a key synergistic role with the “converge and contract” strategy, perhaps to the point of making the need for geoengineering for sustainability only temporary.Harold M Hastings, Tai Young-Taft and Chris CogginsBard College at Simon’s Rock, Barrington, Massachusetts, USA

As companies like Peabody Energy and Exxon Mobil face legal probes over allegedly lying about their exposure, it reinforces moves for greater transparency.
In its first report on Friday, the taskforce emphasised the need to incorporate global warming threats into financial reports.
“That is a big deal,” Curtis Ravenel, a Bloomberg executive on the taskforce’s secretariat told Climate Home. “Once it goes into financial filings, there is all sorts of oversight for companies. The point is to try and institutionalise thinking on this at board level.”
Most G20 countries already require businesses to disclose “material” climate-related risks in their financial reports. But interpretations of what is “material” vary.
Carbon-cutting regulations, clean technology and lawsuits can all hit the value of companies that rely on burning fossil fuels.
Mark Carney, chair of the Financial Stability Board, last year warned there could be market shocks if investors failed to anticipate these trends.
Long-term investors like pension funds are increasingly urging coal and oil majors to face up to the potential carbon crunch.
Yet they face resistance from firms like Exxon Mobil, which maintains that demand for energy will trump global efforts to curb warming.
Members of Bloomberg’s taskforce represent companies ranging from mining giant BHP Billiton to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
They are set to publish a final report by the end of 2016, with voluntary guidelines on what kind of information companies should disclose.
“Our thought is companies will want to adopt the guidelines to avoid the kind of legal implications facing Peabody and Exxon,” said Ravenel.
Responding to the initial report, the Carbon Tracker Initiative emphasised the need to test business plans in line with a 2C warming limit.
“Investors no longer want to see regulatory filings from fossil fuel companies that fail to discuss how the low carbon transition might impact their business models,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the London-based think tank.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 120 investors worth €13tn, agreed.
“We strongly support the focus on more standardised disclosures and forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information,” said the group’s chief executive Stephanie Pfeifer. “This will help investors better assess and address carbon risk in their portfolios.”
Jon Williams of consultancy PwC welcomed the taskforce setting out its stall. He said: “There is much ground to cover over the next nine months if it is to deliver on its highly ambitious targets and embed climate-related risks firmly within the financial mainstream.”",413,4.098360655737705e-4,0.06598360655737706,0.6028688524590163,4.098360655737705e-4,4.098360655737705e-4,0.012704918032786885,0.315983606557377,4.098360655737705e-4,4.098360655737705e-4,4.098360655737705e-4

When we came last year, to the same place in the same week, the steep banks of the lanes grew thick with wild roses, fuchsia and foxgloves; now the vegetation looked limper and dustier, the roses drier, the foxgloves solitary and stooped. But a poorer foreground view had its compensation in the background, where the lack of drizzle, cloud and mist revealed a rolling landscape of hills and woods that was unexpectedly Tuscan in its clarity. By four in the afternoon, the airless main streets of the small towns felt like ovens.
On the coast east of Skibbereen we found a delightful cove, of the sort that in my experience rarely exists outside children’s fiction: perfect in its firm sand, its protective reefs of smooth black rock, and its warren of caves that ran back into the cliffs, invaded every day by the tide, and entirely free of plastic flotsam. The sea was calm and clear, and changed its shade of blue according to the depth and composition of the seabed. Moreover, it wasn’t chill. In 60-odd years swimming off the British coastline, I’ve rarely known water as welcoming or as hard to leave: even after 40 minutes, it seemed a shame to get out.
Newspaper reports said the prolonged heatwave had raised sea temperatures in other places to over 20C, which sounded impossibly warm, almost like a heated swimming pool. In that temperature, there would surely be no dallying in the shallows, no theatrical shivering when the water reached crotch level, no complaining that the cold was unbearable, no need to stand there uncertainly while your companion, already swimming briskly, urged you to “get in and get it over with”. Instead immersion would be a swift, Mediterranean experience – a run or brisk walk into the sea and then a splash as you struck out for the diving platform.
Temperatures in the Firth of Forth never made getting into the water so easy. To be consistently tempting, the estuary needed exceptional conditions – and the summer of 1955 provided them. The sun shone for weeks, and day after day my friends and I made the 10-minute walk to the beach – not a Blue Flag candidate, if Blue Flags had existed then, because a pipe ran right down the middle of it that carried sewage to the sea from the army barracks to the rear.
Looking back, it seems odd that people made no fuss about this, or about another more torrential outlet not far upstream, where the sewage turned the sea pink with its infusions of potassium permanganate. But it was a beach, all the same, with a sandbank that appeared at low tide and a hut at the far end that opened on especially busy days to sell crisps and lemonade; and by the second week, I had taught myself to swim.
All kinds of things happened in 1955: Anthony Eden won the general election; Princess Margaret announced that she didn’t intend to marry RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend; Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. I remember none of them. For me, it was the year I was turned brown by the sun.
A family snapshot, one of our first in colour, shows me in swimming trunks, staring across a shiny flat sea towards a visiting American battleship, the USS Wisconsin, which lay anchored in the firth. My back is unselfconsciously brown – there had been no lying on towels and striving for this effect – which tells a story of capering about on the beach with no recourse to the plastic macs and sweaters that in most years the visitor to the Scottish seaside was wise to bring. (As the actor and comedian Stanley Baxter remembers, returned Glaswegian holidaymakers when questioned about the weather might reply stoically, “Well, it never kept us in.”)
The strong sunlight gave everything a memorable clarity, just as it did in Ireland last week, so that certain scenes of no particular emotional importance remain fixed, when in other years they would have faded: the sight of a spoil tip near an old mine or ironworks – abandoned even in 1955 – that revealed an interior of bright red cinders where a jagged crack had split its grassy surface. It makes no sense to remember it, and yet there it is through the window of the Glasgow bus, under a bright blue sky.
Unclothed adults at the seaside were then hardly visible, other than in newspaper pictures of crowded beaches at sophisticated resorts such as Ayr or Blackpool. When my grandfathers came to the beach, they retained their flat caps and waistcoats. My mother never owned a swimsuit. My father had trunks – as a boy he’d liked to swim – but I only once saw him wear them. None of this was very exceptional. I can’t think of any adult in our street who went to the beach and did much more than roll up a trouser leg.
Nobody could have complained, as the aesthete James Lees-Milne did in his diary in July 1976: “Heatwave continuing. Whole country parched, and trees dying. Found E naked but for a pair of long blue shorts, with white skin, smarmed hair (for he had just had a bath), flabby muscles, pendulous breasts, looking like Picasso aged 90. How can aesthetic persons bear to be seen in this condition at 74 even by their intimates?”
The great summers of my lifetime have been 1955, 1976 and now this one. With each, a little more innocence has been shed as well as clothes. Prolonged sunshine now seems ominous – a portent as well as a pleasure. Ireland, for instance, has a rural economy that largely depends on grass, and in a drought grass fails to thrive. That has huge consequences for every cattle farmer, but posterity may see it as no more than a little local difficulty, one of the negligible effects of a global temperature change that melts glaciers and ice caps. Carpe diem, then, in a cove near Skibbereen.

Asked by the New York Times whether he would pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by 196 nations, Trump said: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.”
The president-elect also wavered on his previously stated position that climate change is a “hoax” and just a “very, very expensive form of tax”.
Questioned over the link between human activity and global warming, Trump said: “I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much.” He added that he was thinking about how the issue “will cost our companies”.
Trump’s partial acceptance of the overwhelming scientific view that burning fossil fuels is changing the climate, along with his equivocation over American involvement in the Paris deal, are subtle departures from the position he took during the presidential campaign.
Trump has said he would “cancel” the Paris climate agreement, which was ratified earlier this month and requires a three-year notice period to quit. The president-elect has said he would also cut all money spent on climate change aid to developing nations and slash clean energy funding.
The election of an apparent climate change denier to the US presidency has caused consternation among scientists and overseas climate negotiators, but some have voiced hope that Trump will follow a more pragmatic path that will avoid political fallout over the issue.
In Trump’s recent pronouncements on his first 100 days in power he has pledged to cancel money for climate change programs and lift restrictions upon fossil fuel exploration on public land, but made no mention of quitting the Paris deal.
Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, said of his latest comments: “Talk is cheap, and no one should believe Donald Trump means this until he acts upon it. We’re waiting for action, and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer. Prove it, president-elect.

Swathes of corals in all tropical basins have been hit by the longest mass bleaching event yet recorded that kicked off in 2014 and ended, at least officially, in June. 
Fossil fuel burning is firmly linked to rising ocean temperatures that push the corals into a stress reaction – they expel the special algae that give them their colour and most of their nutrients. It’s not certain death, but it can take five to 10 years for even the fastest growing coral species to fully recover.
On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, one research group found the abnormally hot conditions that caused corals to bleach in 2016 were 175 times more likely under today’s climate than one that hadn’t been loaded with extra carbon dioxide. 
In 2016 about 30% of all corals on the reef died. In 2017 James Cook University’s Prof Terry Hughes estimates another 19% died. 
And all this as global warming reaches just 1C. What happens to coral reefs at 1.5C of warming – the target set by the United Nations Paris climate agreement? Or higher?
It’s under this stark reality that a group of 18 mainly Australian scientists and reef managers, including those in government agencies, have waded in with a controversial proposal in an article in the science journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. 
Existing conservation approaches, such as improving water quality around reefs and imposing restrictions or bans on fishing, are not working, the article says. 
Instead, the scientists argue: “New and potentially riskier interventions must be implemented alongside conventional management efforts and strong action to curb global warming.” 
Those interventions include “assisted evolution” – a suite of techniques that have been commonly used in commercial settings (think of selective breeding in plants and livestock as one example) but are now being considered as a way to develop coral species that have better tolerance of the heat extremes that reefs are increasingly facing. 
Another idea is known as “assisted gene flow” – and involves essentially moving coral larvae or corals that can cope with higher temperatures into areas where current coral species are dying. 
Much further down the track, the authors also suggest developments in synthetic biology where beneficial genes are either created or selected from the same species. 
Across all these methods, the authors write there are multiple issues, some ethical and some practical, that need to be much better understood. But the time to start is now. 
For example, physically moving coral species could see dangerous pathogens hitching a ride. Or, once in place, transplanted coral could simply die because of a lack of adaptation to local conditions.
How do you select which species to “save” and which ones to discard? With those decisions, also come knock-on effects of the multiple marine species that rely on those coral habitats. 
How would the public react to an “artificial reef” or the inevitable claims that scientists are playing God? 
It could all get very messy and very costly.
Several leading scientists I’ve spoken to say a key danger in advocating technological fixes is that it could be an excuse to ignore what everyone agrees is the main game – cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possibly.
The lead author of the new article is Dr Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian government’s Australian Institute of Marine Science.
Anthony accepted that some in the science community could see the pursuit of unconventional methods as a tacit admission of defeat on the emissions front. 
“But we need a philosophy where we don’t just give up,” he told me. “We do need two balls in play. We need to fix climate change and the more we can mitigate carbon, the better the chances that these things will work. It is not an either, or, situation.
“But we agree it’s controversial to talk about this … We have to start looking at the reef in an objective way. How can we protect habitats that protect species?”
We need to find solutions, but I don’t think growing corals is part of that
James Cook University’s Prof Terry Hughes, a director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and also the convenor of the national coral bleaching taskforce, is deeply skeptical about the viability of many of the proposed techniques.
In particular, whether corals are developed in laboratories or are physically transferred from one location to another, the physical placement of corals on reef structures is “extremely expensive”. 
He said: “I actually see this problem we are now facing – with back-to-back bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef killing about half the corals – that this is more a governance problem. What’s broken is not so much the corals – they don’t need fixing – but the legal frameworks, the politics and the institutions.
“We need to find solutions, but I don’t think growing corals is part of that. I think it’s about changing people’s attitudes and behaviours and getting carbon dioxide emissions down by transitioning away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Without that, nothing else really works.”
People are now operating under the terms that everything should be on the table
On this point, AIMS’s Anthony is in agreement. “The better outcome we get in terms of carbon mitigation, the better chance we stand with conventional and these new interventions,” he says. “I can’t imagine having success where you don’t have both. As I said, you have to have two balls in play and if you drop either of them, then it could be game over.”
Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of Coral Reef Watch at the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, thought it was “responsible and necessary” to have open discussions about alternative strategies.
“Corals and coral reefs are now at a critical juncture,” he told me by email. “Conventional conservation measures alone are no longer enough. We need to be looking at all of the tools in our toolboxes.” 
But critically, Eakin added: “The biggest danger of moving in this direction is the potential that some will see this as being a way to engineer our way out of the problem — using it as an excuse to not act on the rising CO2 that is the ultimate cause of the problem.”
Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a leading marine biologist and director of the University of Queensland’s global change institute, is a pioneer in coral bleaching research. 
He told me there was a “movement sweeping the coral research community” in response to the massive and unprecedented bleaching at reefs around the world.
“The pace of environmental change is outstripping the natural ability of corals to keep up, and people are now operating under the terms that everything should be on the table. That’s reasonable.” 
But he said each time the media reported on new technological fixes, there was a ripple effect among politicians looking for a way out. 
“A solution might look good on paper and yes, you can grow heat-resistant corals in a lab, but nobody wants to talk about the economics. Once you scale these things up, they can become very expensive.”
One study looking at marine restoration projects found coral reefs were the most expensive to restore, with costs as high as $1.8m per hectare (the entire Great Barrier Reef covers about 35m hectares). 
Hoegh-Guldberg offered up a “back of the envelope” calculation on costs.
The Great Barrier Reef is 40,000 sq km. If you were to grow a coral in a lab and transplant it every five metres at $5 each time, then this gives a cost of about $40bn, “and that’s just for one single species,” he says. Scale this up globally, and he says you easily get to costs in the trillions of dollars. 
“We are in a desperate situation and we need to try all sorts of things because you don’t know what might work,” he says. 
“But on the other hand, you can get distracted from the main game. The only economic way to deal with this issue is to reduce emissions and take up renewable energies at a furious rate,” he says.
“Clearly we have to think outside the box, but let’s not pretend the core issue is not reducing emissions. For coral reefs, it’s really the Paris agreement and 1.5C … or bust.”",1383,1.680672268907563e-4,0.07915966386554622,1.680672268907563e-4,0.4405042016806723,0.06571428571428571,0.20016806722689073,0.08252100840336135,1.680672268907563e-4,1.680672268907563e-4,0.13126050420168067

But telling anti-vaxxers they’re stupid won’t fix it | Ellie Mae O’Hagan,"Simply telling people they are ignorant has failed. We need to find a better way to communicate, says freelance journalist Ellie Mae O’Hagan","After reading the news that cases of measles have soared by 50% in the last year, I recalled the first time I heard an anti-vaccination conspiracy theory. It wasn’t from a member of Donald Trump’s administration, or part of a frenetic, grammatically challenged Facebook post – it was from a classmate when I was at school. Her family wasn’t waging a crusade against medical science: they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield’s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Back then, the study had not yet been discredited.
One only has to stray into anti-vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they’re stuffed with conspiracy theorists, opportunists, reactionaries, and – worst of all – hubristic idiots. This is the vanguard of the anti-vaxxer movement. But behind that vanguard are a lot of concerned parents who are being convinced of wild and dangerous ideas because we – and by we, I mean those of us who recognise the incontrovertible fact that vaccines are essential – aren’t talking to them properly. A number of the anti-vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents, but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they’re getting from the other side is that they’re foolish and irresponsible. Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti-vaxxers, or a listicle of their “horrifyingly stupid” social media posts.
A neat example of poor communication by those who are trying to stem anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories is a 2017 study called “Misinformation lingers in memory” by the University of Edinburgh, which found that using myth-busting techniques actually increased participants’ tendency to wrongly believe in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In other words, simply repeating a vaccination conspiracy theory and then debunking it with facts makes people more likely to believe the conspiracy theory than they did before, because reminding people of the conspiracy theory – even in order to discredit it – lodges it deeper in the public consciousness. This is not only the fault of the people hearing these arguments – it is our failure; it is a failure of communication.
The Public Interest Research Centre , a communications organisation I sometimes work with, argues that miscommunications like these happen because we tend to think of human beings as fact-processing machines. We assume that if we make a factual argument loudly and often enough, people will eventually become overpowered by its inherent logic, believe it, and even start arguing it themselves. Most of the recent events in politics and society, including the finding that measles cases are increasing, should be evidence enough that this is assumption is entirely wrong, and that by leaning on it, we simply enlarge a gulf of understanding between us and the people we are trying to communicate with. Frustrated that they cannot see the world in the same way we do, we call them idiots and chancers, we denounce their beliefs – and then we wonder why they’re not coming around to our way of thinking.
Over the past 30 years, during which free-market technocratic politics has been the dominant ideology, populations have been encouraged to believe that there is an agreed set of facts that we all must adhere to for the greater good, and that those who question these facts are a dangerous menace. But in the last five or 10 years, this ideology has begun to crumble, and as a result more and more people are beginning to question who is giving them facts and what their agenda might be. Following events such as the Iraq war and the financial crisis, which were so defined by greed and deception, some public scepticism is rational and maybe even welcome. But the anti-vaxxer movement has been given a shot in the arm, no pun intended, by this general collapse of trust in the establishment, which has been largely misunderstood, dismissed or even demonised by the traditional gatekeepers of public discourse.
What began as scepticism about political ideals and ways of organising societies has spilled over into scientific disciplines where a shared agreement of the facts and reliance on empirical evidence is absolutely necessary. The anti-vaxxer movement is what happens when public scepticism is not fully understood or empathised with, and when defunct methods of experts shouting facts over and over again are the only response. The vacuum created by this lack of empathy is then filled by malicious actors who want to present themselves as the authority instead, and to erode trust in science to promote phenomena such as climate change denialism, or in a shared understanding of human rights in order to discriminate against others. This week, Darla Shine, the wife of the White House director of communications, went on a Twitter tirade  (something for which she has form – having previously used the platform to question why white people aren’t allowed to use the n-word, given its use by black people) against measles vaccines. People like Shine, and Trump, take advantage of the general atmosphere of disinformation in order to assert harmful and inaccurate arguments as universal truths.
If we want to defeat the anti-vaxxer movement, we need to understand why it exists, and the increase in its popularity. We need to look at the wider context that allowed such a dangerous and obviously wrongheaded movement to flourish so unchecked. It might make us feel good to denounce anti-vaxxers as villains, but it doesn’t seem to be working. And as long as the attempts to stop anti-vaxxers fail, more and more children will be put at risk.

A scenario that takes into account the latest cost reduction projections for the green technologies, and countries’ pledges to cut emissions, finds that solar power and electric vehicles are “gamechangers” that could leave fossil fuels stranded. 
Polluting fuels could lose 10% of market share to solar power and clean cars within a decade, the report by the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London and the Carbon Tracker Initiative found. 
A 10% loss of market share was enough to cause the collapse of the coal mining industry in the US, while Europe’s five major utilities lost €100bn (£85bn) between 2008 and 2013 because they did not prepare for an 8% increase in renewables, the report said. 
Big energy companies are seriously underestimating the low-carbon transition by sticking to their “business as usual” scenarios which expect continued growth of fossil fuels, and could see their assets “stranded”, the study claims. 
Emerging technology, such as printable solar photovoltaics which generate electricity, could bring down costs and boost take-up even more than currently predicted. 
Luke Sussams, a senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said: “Electric vehicles and solar power are gamechangers that the fossil fuel industry consistently underestimates. 
“Further innovation could make our scenarios look conservative in five years’ time, in which case the demand misread by companies will have been amplified even more.” 
James Leaton, head of research at Carbon Tracker, added: “There are a number of low-carbon technologies about to achieve critical mass decades before some companies expect.” 
The cost of solar has fallen 85% in seven years, and the report finds panels could supply 23% of global power generation by 2040 and 29% by 2050, entirely phasing coal out and leaving natural gas with just a 1% share. 
By 2035, electric vehicles could make up 35% of the road transport market, and two-thirds by 2050, when it could displace 25m barrels of oil per day. 
Under such a scenario, coal and oil demand could peak in 2020, while the growth in gas demand could be curtailed. 
It could also limit global temperature rises to between 2.4C and 2.7C above pre-industrial levels, while more ambitious action by countries than currently pledged, along with falling costs of solar and electric vehicles, could limit warming to 2.1C to 2.3C. 
But the report shows that cutting carbon from the power sector and road transport may not be enough to achieve international climate targets, so emissions reductions from other sectors such as heating buildings and heavy industry will also be needed.",439,0.013839285714285715,0.7816964285714285,0.15223214285714287,4.4642857142857147e-4,4.4642857142857147e-4,0.009375,0.040625,4.4642857142857147e-4,4.4642857142857147e-4,4.4642857142857147e-4

As climate change helps push up the number of wildfires in the western US, communities face losing lives and properties to the flames. But another threat also looms large – dangerous exposure to wildfire smoke.
Huge wildfires in California have killed at least six people and razed hundreds of homes. A pall of smoke has shrouded much of California and has wafted eastwards, with Nasa satellites showing fingers of smoke billowing as far as Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Much of the smoke from the two fires – near the city of Redding and another close to Yosemite national park - has remained close to ground level, prompting air quality warnings.
“A big wildfire event not only impacts local communities but also people hundreds of miles away,” said Richard Peltier, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts. “Even if your home isn’t being destroyed and you think ‘this isn’t my problem’ you could suffer serious health effects.”
Once a forest turns into a roaring fire, plumes of sooty smoke containing gases and microscopic particles are released. This can cause a range of symptoms such as coughing, burning eyes and shortness of breath.
More seriously, the smoke can trigger asthma attacks or, more chronically, lead to heart problems and has even been linked to the development of cancer. As summers become longer, warmer and drier in the US west, forests are being transformed into perfect staging grounds for repeated wildfires of increasing ferocity. 
In the 1980s, there was an average of 140 wildfires that burned through 1,000 acres or more each year – this number grew to 250 wildfires a year between 2000 and 2012. 
There is evidence that the increase in wildfires is already taking a toll on Americans’ health. While overall air quality has improved in the US over the past 30 years, wildfire-prone states in the northwest are a glaring exception and are actually getting worse, new research has found.
Researchers at the University of Washington looked through data on the very worst bad air days, totaling roughly a week each year, across the country since 1988. While the rest of the country has experienced a sharp improvement in air quality, a sprawling patch that includes parts of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, much of Utah and Nevada, and parts of California, Oregon and Washington has got significantly worse.
“There’s a big red bullseye over that northern Rockies area where they are getting the big wildfires,” said Dan Jaffe, a co-author of the study. “There’s been a big improvement in air quality in the US but wildfires like the ones we are seeing in California are eating away at those gains. In some cases the smoke is bringing very bad air quality.”
Wildfire smoke can be identified as a culprit because air samples from the west show high levels of organic materials in the particulate matter. Samples taken near industrial sources such as coal power plants typically show more sulphur.
The link between the smoke and illness or death is sometimes complicated, however, by the fact it exacerbates a range of conditions that cause the sickness. No death certificate cites “air pollution” as the cause of death. 
Researchers also complain there is a lack of data to link specific fires with illnesses in nearby communities. But the overall trend is clear – warmer, drier weather will lead to more wildfires which will spill more smoke into vulnerable lungs.
“Wildfires are a growing problem and climate change is making them worse,” said Peltier. “When you expose people to higher levels of pollution, they are more likely to become ill. We know more wildfires will mean more deaths. Almost every place in the US, apart from maybe Hawaii, could be impacted by upwind smoke.
“There have been a lot of predictions that if we don’t get ahead of climate change that crazy things will happen. Well, crazy things are happening. This is what climate change looks like.”",649,0.6277777777777778,3.2679738562091506e-4,0.06568627450980392,0.15065359477124182,3.2679738562091506e-4,0.11143790849673203,3.2679738562091506e-4,3.2679738562091506e-4,0.03954248366013072,0.0035947712418300656

Several of the state’s branches have endorsed the LNP push for the federal government to build “high energy, low emissions coal-fired power stations and the orderly closing down of older technology coal-fired power stations in order to drive down electricity prices, reduce emissions and promote economic growth”.
While the coal push favours government intervention, separate proposals on renewable energy call for the state and federal governments “to apply policies which affirm the LNP’s commitment to the free market provision of least-cost, secure and reliable energy supplies from all technologies where their use is economically viable and technically feasible”.
Nuclear power will also be back on the agenda at the LNP conference, with the Fairfax branch pushing for the consideration of “the feasibility of nuclear power generation in Australia”.
The weekend motions come as Tony Abbott has attempted this week to exploit internal divisions within the Turnbull government over the Neg in an effort to torpedo the policy.
Abbott used a speech to a forum of climate sceptics to declare Australia should withdraw from the Paris agreement – a treaty he joined Australia to while prime minister – as a precursor for dumping the Neg.
The government’s energy policy is supported by a majority of Liberals and some Nationals, and there is internal frustration about Abbott’s antics. 
Some Nationals want Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg to agree to provide transitional assistance for the coal sector, either through subsidies for coal stations or bankrolling retrofitting to extend the life of existing plants while lowering emissions.
That internal push is being driven out of Queensland. Labor has earmarked at least 10 of the government’s Queensland seats as vulnerable, making the state the potential election swinger, and support for a coal-inclusive energy future is gaining traction with MPs in marginal seats.
With pro-coal forces in the government on the march, during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter recess the Coalition voted with One Nation in the Senate, backing a motion calling on the government “to facilitate the building of new coal-fired power stations and the retrofitting of existing baseload power stations”.
While it is clear that agreeing to some assistance for coal would help smooth over the government’s internal divisions on the policy, a coal side deal would create problems with Labor states and territories who have to sign off on the policy in early August.
Some Labor states and the ACT will be highly attentive to any deal the Turnbull government strikes internally to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants, given some of them are already of the view the emissions reduction in the Neg is nowhere near ambitious enough for Australia to meet its Paris commitments.
Any one of the states or the ACT could scuttle the policy because implementing it requires agreement across participants in the national electricity market.
A coal side deal could also derail bipartisan consensus on the Neg with Labor in Canberra. The Turnbull government will need Labor’s support to get the policy through the parliament.
The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has already warned the government that new subsidies for coal as part of any internal settlement on the Neg will scuttle the chances of securing peace after 10 years of warring over climate and energy policy.
Butler said in late June: “We’re not going to agree to a model that seeks to fly in the face of all of the expert advice, from industry and stakeholders, that building new coal-fired power stations would mean there is no way of achieving our commitments under the Paris agreement and also would deliver higher priced electricity to households and businesses.”

Happer is well known for his contrarian views (that’s the polite term) on human-caused climate change.
So when it emerged last week that the professor might seriously be in the running to be President Donald Trump’s science adviser, that Princeton tag no doubt added an air of authority to his opinions. 
In short, Happer thinks more CO2 will only be good for the planet – putting him at odds with science academies around the world.
“There’s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,” Happer told the Guardian. “It’s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They’re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.” 
Happer has also compared the “demonisation” of carbon dioxide to the “demonisation of poor Jews under Hitler” – because a Nazi reference will always get you noticed.
But here’s the thing — the first of many to note about Happer. First, he is not, by any stretch, an expert on climate change science.
Happer’s record of getting scientific papers published in leading journals on climate change science is at, or very close to, zero. Simply, he knows a lot about some stuff, but he is not a climate scientist.
While he has a distinguished career as an atomic physicist, previously serving the administration of George HW Bush as a science director, the 77-year-old’s views on climate science are outnumbered by all the credible evidence, all the credible science agencies and are also being laughed at by the Earth’s thermometers and its melting ice sheets and glaciers.
Prof Michael Oppenheimer has scores of articles on climate science in leading journals going back to the mid-1990s. He’s a climate scientist … at Princeton.
So what does Oppenheimer think of his colleague?
“With respect to climate science and scientists,” Oppenheimer told me by email, “[Happer] is not only unknowledgeable but appears to have become unmoored.”
Ouch. But then, maybe Oppenheimer has glassy eyes? 
Happer has laid out his thoughts on climate change in some detail in an ongoing Focused Civil Dialogue (my irony meter just exploded) with the Australian climate scientist Prof David Karoly.
While Happer’s contribution seems technical, it’s the same parade of zombie talking points that actual climate scientists have been dealing with for years. 
Happer says CO2 levels and temperatures have been much higher in the past and that life “flourished” under these conditions many millions of years ago. 
He doesn’t mention that during those times sea levels were probably several metres – sometimes well over 10 metres – higher than they are today. If that’s the world you want to advocate, then it’s time to call the removal guys for most of the world’s major coastal cities. 
The climate scientist Dr Nerilie Abram, of Australian National University, specialises in the climate of the ancient past. She told me: 
Warm periods in Earth’s past tell us a lot about how our climate works and what we can expect if we don’t act to halt current climate change. The last time that temperatures were similar to now, this caused parts of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to slowly melt and sea level globally ended up six to nine metres higher than now. If we go back 3 million years – the last time carbon dioxide levels were at today’s level – sea level was probably around 10 to 40 metres higher. Life on Earth might not be fazed by those numbers or even higher ones, but for human civilisations they would be catastrophic.
Happer also rolls out that mouldy old chestnut that CO2 is just food for plants, but ignores the research on the impacts that higher concentrations of CO2 will have on our global food supply. 
Research into some staple crops such as rice, wheat and sorghum, for example, finds that they end up with less protein when CO2 is at higher concentrations. That’s before you worry about how food crops will cope with droughts and heatwaves. 
At a conference in December Happer said his “main concern” was that climate change was “likely to damage public perceptions of science”. 
If Happer is concerned about the reputation of science, then he’s picking some very odd places to hang around – that conference being one of them.
The Arizona gathering was organised by Freedom Force International – a group led by the famed conspiracy theorist G Edward Griffin. He fits right in with the booming culture of conspiracy that’s growing big audiences online.
Among many other things, Griffin has said there is “no such thing” as HIV and that human-caused climate change is a hoax. 
Griffin also promotes conspiracies around “chemtrails”. Just punch that word into your favourite search engine for hours of family fun (don’t actually do that). 
To summarise, there’s a plan to spray the atmosphere with chemicals added to planes to poison everyone and “they” are using weather modification as a weapon.
Griffin has said “somebody is spending a lot of money and effort to spray the planet” and that this is probably some international effort.
Also appearing at the conference was the British hereditary peer and climate science denier Lord Christopher Monckton, who likes to say he was appointed as a reviewer of the last big UN intergovernmental panel on climate change report without mentioning that, literally, you need no qualifications and can “appoint” yourself.
Happer’s speech to the conference isn’t yet online but an interview he gave at the venue after is. 
He goes over the same ground. CO2 is really awesome and life would be much better if there was a lot more of it.
“I don’t think there are any cons to CO2 … we are really in a CO2 famine,” he says. “My main concern is that it’s likely to damage public perceptions of science. I am hoping that I and other scientists can persuade the public that we are not all for sale.”
I’m struggling to understand how someone concerned with the reputation of science would want to lend his name, and the name of Princeton University, to a conference organised by conspiracy theorists. 
This is also the bit when we mention that Happer was caught in a sting by Greenpeace activists in 2015, when he offered to write a report on the benefits of carbon dioxide for a fake fossil fuel client while avoiding any need to disclose the funding’s source.
Happer asked that rather than pay him, the fake lobbyists should instead pay the CO2 Coalition – a climate science denial group based in the US. Tax documents list Happer as a director and president.
He has also given evidence in a court case on behalf of the coal company Peabody Energy where he similarly asked that his fee go to the CO2 Coalition. He laid these facts out in emails released by Greenpeace, stating that the coalition did not pay him any fees or salary.
Remembering Happer’s dislike of science being “for sale”, it’s noteworthy that his CO2 Coalition colleague Patrick Moore was paid last year by a major European coal lobby organisation to give a presentation in Strasbourg telling the audience we should “celebrate CO2”.
No doubt Happer would argue that money does not influence the views of people like Moore, though he does say that it influences actual climate scientists who get research grants from universities and governments. Go figure.
Whether or not Happer gets the gig as Trump’s science adviser remains to be seen. But given the climate science deniers and fossil fuel advocates who Trump has already employed, it seems Happer will fit right in.",1267,0.05889908256880734,0.005688073394495413,0.007522935779816513,0.03321100917431193,0.02403669724770642,0.5598165137614679,0.013027522935779816,1.834862385321101e-4,0.15614678899082568,0.14146788990825687

The world’s biggest international oil company has been investigated in the US over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global warming for decades but deceived the public over the risks, a charge the firm has rejected.
EU politicians will now turn their attention to the role the company has played in Europe, where it has a sizeable presence from the huge Groningen gas field in the Netherlands to oil and gas fields in the North Sea.
MEPs on the environment, public health and food safety committee will quiz a series of speakers on misinformation campaigns on climate change, which could include representatives of the company.
The hearing on 21 March, jointly held by the petitions committee, comes after a petition by fossil fuel campaigners calling for a closer look at the information the company “wants to withhold from us now”.
“ExxonMobil has misled the public on climate change for over 40 years. Now it’s time to correct the record and hold them accountable,” said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food &amp; Water Europe, which organised the petition.
She called on the the new US Congress to follow the European parliament’s lead.
“The weak outcome of the climate negotiations in Poland show that we can’t wait – leaders everywhere must take climate denial and climate action seriously,” she said, in reference to the UN climate talks which concluded on Saturday.
The group would like to see lobbyists for the company barred from Brussels because of the firm’s alleged past behaviour.
Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, agreed that lobbying of EU institutions by companies that had been linked to climate denial should not be permitted.
She said: “Exxon has a shameful history of funding climate change denial – paying for fake science and dangerous lies that have prevented us from taking timely action on climate change and forcing the world into the current climate crisis.”
An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research. We understand that climate risks are real.”
In recent years the company has softened its stance on climate change, urging the US to stay in the Paris climate agreement and agreeing to join an industry alliance on climate change.
The company has recently been targeted by shareholders calling on it to set carbon targets at ExxonMobil’s AGM next year.",425,4.8543689320388353e-4,4.8543689320388353e-4,0.16553398058252428,0.019902912621359223,4.8543689320388353e-4,0.14611650485436894,0.262621359223301,0.0587378640776699,0.34514563106796114,4.8543689320388353e-4

But for ecosystems up and down the country – languishing far from the cities and the social media glare – there was no escape.
Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology confirmed 2018 was the hottest December since records began in 1910, while January was the hottest month ever recorded.
Climate change has altered Australia’s weather patterns. The BoM and CSIRO say the country has warmed by more than 1C since 1910, and temperatures will continue to rise.
There have been obvious signs: bushfires, drought and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. But there have also been less headline-grabbing climate change-related tragedies. Based on studies of past extreme heat events, the affect of this summer’s heatwaves on Australia’s flora and fauna would have been severe, fundamental and, in some cases, deadly.
“I think in a lot of places it would have been carnage,” says James Cook University ecologist Prof Bill Laurance of the January heatwave. “We have just had records after records being broken. We only tend to notice when things start dropping out of the trees. We know that basically, lots of things are dying.”
According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.
So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?
The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.
They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.
The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.
Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.
These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.
Prof Ary Hoffmann, a biologist at the University of Melbourne, has studied the impact of climate change on natural systems for more than two decades.
“You are going to get some major ecosystem changes,” he says, “but it’s the interactions that drive things. Our extremes are getting much greater, and so the consequences are going to be greater.”
One study found: “Summer heatwaves and winter warm spells will increase in frequency, duration and amplitude across Australia.” Increases in extreme heat conditions and shifting rainfall patterns have already been seen across the continent.
We know that in heatwaves animals have a temperature threshold and above that, they start to die
One 2018 study, led by Hoffmann, pulled together eight case studies showing how aspects of climate change such as drought, extreme heat and changes to rainfall were working together to devastate ecosystems.
Pest outbreaks – themselves likely promoted by climate change – were harming trees already struggling though persistent droughts and heatwaves. Intervals between bushfires were not long enough to allow seeds to germinate and “drastic management interventions” were required to keep alpine ash ecosystems viable. Birds and mammals in the wet tropics were moving up mountains to stay in their preferred temperature ranges.
According to Laurance, the damage caused by climate change is mostly out of sight of field biologists, and major problems caused by heatwaves can go undetected for years, if they are found at all.
He cites the case of the rare white lemuroid ringtail possum. In 2008, after hearing reports the possums had gone missing, Laurance tried to find one in north Queensland. He and others concluded a heatwave three years earlier had killed many, pushing the species closer to the brink. The possums cannot survive for more than a few hours if temperatures rise above 30C.
“Lots of people think heatwaves will be dangerous for things in cooler climates, but probably the tropics and tropical mountains will be where we lose most of our biodiversity,” Laurance says.
“We know that in heatwaves animals have a temperature threshold and above that, they start to die.
“There are silent crises happening all around us and it might be a few years down the track that we work out the skinks and frogs and plants that have died off.”
Heatwaves cause the most damage when they arrive on top of other stressors such as fragmented habitats, drought, disease and fire.
Last year scientists published an analysis of a 2011 heatwave in Western Australia. They found it had affected an area larger than Victoria – more than 300,000 sq km – spanning land and ocean.
An article published in the journal Scientific Reports said the heatwave caused “tree die-off and coral bleaching” as well as “terrestrial plant mortality, seagrass and kelp loss, population crash of an endangered terrestrial bird species, plummeting breeding success in marine penguins, and outbreaks of terrestrial wood-boring insects”.
Co-author Joseph Fontaine, an ecologist at Murdoch University, says: “We are getting more heatwaves and less time in between them. If you are a plant that’s close to your threshold then you’re going to die faster if it’s already hotter than it used to be.”
The heatwaves have a knock-on effect, he explains: “Here in the south-west we have these fantastic black cockatoos and they rely on the resources in the trees – the seeds – from eucalypts and banksia cones. If these events affect trees, then the resources are gone and the trees won’t produce food the following year.”
Ecologists are concerned by the speed of changes in the climate and how normally adaptable species are failing to keep up.
“Given that in Australia the climate is so variable and most of our animals and plants should be adapted to that, we start to ask: why is it that we are seeing so many impacts?” says University of Tasmania climate impact scientist Rebecca Harris.
“We keep talking about this as something that’s in the future, but we are seeing impacts now. Heatwaves and bushfires are what people are aware of, but there are many other impacts.”
Last year Harris led a study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looking at how Australia’s ecosystems coped with both long-term and sudden extreme climate change events.
“A single extreme event can be sufficient to cause irreversible regime shift or an ecosystem ‘tipping point’,” the study said.
Among the examples were the pencil pine forests in Tasmania devastated by fire in 2016; a “boom and bust” of extreme rainfall and heat in arid areas coinciding with massive outbreaks of rodents, and then bushfires; and in 2016 mangroves dying en masse along a 1,000km stretch of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
“We thought those undisturbed places would be more resilient,” says Harris. “But we showed that just wasn’t the case.”",1129,0.5388030888030888,0.004054054054054054,1.9305019305019305e-4,0.3631274131274131,1.9305019305019305e-4,0.0638996138996139,1.9305019305019305e-4,1.9305019305019305e-4,0.004054054054054054,0.02528957528957529

So why aren’t more states getting onboard?","Nestled between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee, the Watts Bar 2 nuclear power plant sits on 1,700 acres in an area friendly to nuclear power. It’s near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which might be best remembered for its work on the Manhattan Project. The 1,150-megawatt plant is undergoing testing to go fully online this month, and will join the existing 1,100-megawatt Watts Bar plant, which already provides 650,000 area homes with electricity that emits zero carbon emissions.
When Watts Bar 2 is fully operational, it will be the 100th operating nuclear power plant in the US, the country with the most nuclear power stations in the world.
Watts Bar 2 is making history for being the first nuclear power plant to be built in the US in two decades. Its existence also happens at a time when the role of nuclear power in the country’s energy future is uncertain. While states such as California are shutting down nuclear power plants over safety concerns, other states see nuclear power playing an important role in their march to replace fossil fuels with energy sources that emit little or no emissions. Georgia and South Carolina, for example, are currently building plants.
The number of states that support nuclear is by no means high. Although 29 states have renewable energy goals, until recently, only Indiana and Ohio expressly included nuclear energy in those strategies. But other states are starting to craft plans to subsidize nuclear power generation, which accounts for 20% of the nation’s total electricity production. 
Unlike coal and natural gas plants that emit carbon emissions while producing electricity, nuclear generates none and accounts for 63% of the country’s zero-emission electricity, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a nuclear power advocacy group. 
New York recently joined the two other states by including nuclear as part of its clean energy plan, which calls for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. The move illustrates the difficulties of reaching the goal with renewables such as solar and wind alone. 
“If you think of the time it will take to make those renewable additions, we are digging the hole too deep on carbon emissions and losing time. New York did the right thing,” said Paul Meier, an environmental engineer at Blumont Engineering Solutions, specializing in modeling energy and emissions scenarios. 
The new plan also includes an unusual subsidy program to pay struggling nuclear plant owners more for the power. The subsidy program reflects a major shift in energy planning in an era of historically low natural gas prices, increased availability of renewable energy and new technology development to generate and deliver electricity more efficiently.
What makes New York’s subsidy program unique is it’s the first time that nuclear power will receive the same environmental and social benefits ascribed to wind and solar, said Gene Grecheck, former president of the American Nuclear Society, a professional organization of engineers and scientists and a current co-chair of a committee at the society that advises state policy makers. 
Unlike wind and solar energy which receive hefty federal and state subsidies, nuclear providers have not seen the same support despite providing a consistent, large scale and reliable carbon-free energy. The enormous cost of developing a nuclear power plant and safety concerns that grew out of the three melting Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors in Japan in 2011 have made nuclear seem a risky option for addressing climate change. 
Each nuclear power plant could take around $10bn and 10 years to develop and build, said Matt Crozat, NEI’s senior director of business policy. Justifying that cost is tough at a time when natural gas doesn’t have the same risk profile, and its price is low.
The US Energy Information Administration estimates the cost for producing electricity averages $56.40 per megawatt hour at new, basic natural gas plants and $99.70 per megawatt hour at nuclear plants. The production costs, which take into account tax credits, average $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind power and $58.2 per megawatt hour for energy from solar panels.
As a result, nuclear is a particularly expensive energy in states that allow multiple electricity retailers to do business in the same region. A utility that buys nuclear power will likely have to raise the price it charges and become a less desirable option. In states that allow utilities monopolies, such as California, the utilities need to justify the higher rates when they seek state approval to charge customers more, but they don’t have to worry about competition. 
Since 2013, about 13 nuclear plants around the country have been or are slated for shutdown, largely because of low natural gas prices and the rise of renewable energy, NEI said. California plans to close its last nuclear power plant in about nine years. Illinois has not come up a plan to avoid early retirement for two plants. Nebraska’s nuclear plant will close, said Edward Kee, chief executive officer of the Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. Ohio is trying to come up with a plan to keep its Davis-Besse nuclear plant going.
Under the new program, New York is requiring its energy suppliers to start, in April 2017, to pay to pay a premium for nuclear energy because of its environmental benefit.
The higher revenues will make two of New York’s plants profitable and help the third at least break even, said Lela Jgerenaia, US power market analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In 2015, the average wholesale electricity prices for the two plants ranged from $22.49 per megawatt hour to $39.36 per megawatt hour. The average cost of running nuclear power plants nationwide is about $35 per megawatt hour to run, Kee said. 
If the three struggling plants in New York closed today, the state’s carbon emissions would increase by more than 31m metric tons during the next two years, resulting in public health and other societal costs of at least $1.4bn, the governor’s office said. In the first two years of the 12-year program, the credits are forecast to cost about $1bn and raise residential power bills by less than $2 a month, the office added.
Geoffrey Heal, professor at Columbia Business School with a focus on environmental economics, applauds New York’s decision to create the zero-carbon emission credits, rather than seek to close and replace them with natural gas plants.
“If you really want to reduce carbon substantially – and the US stated in its Paris (climate agreement) submission that it would like for these carbon emissions to be down 80% by 2050 – that would mean basically taking all fossil fuels out of electricity production. If you’re going to go carbon free in power generation, you have to have wind, solar and nuclear,” Heal said.
Whether New York will lead other states to use emissions credits to support nuclear power is too early to tell, Grecheck said. 
Public opposition to nuclear has historically played a role in prolonging the time and cost of developing a power plant. But lately, some environmentalists believe climate change is so far gone they’re willing to overlook the pitfalls of nuclear, including the headache with disposing of toxic nuclear waste.
For Bob Brecha, professor and research director for the Hanley Sustainability Institute at University of Dayton in Ohio, the best role currently for nuclear is to be a substitute for fossil fuels until wind and solar, along with technology to store these intermittent energy sources, can meet 100% of the power needs. 
Environmental objection remains strong for groups such as the Sierra Club, which opposes to the nuclear provision in New York’s clean energy plan.
“It does not make sense to force New York’s consumers to buy expensive, dangerous nuclear power when real clean energy options are available for less, and with costs continuing to fall,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director, for Sierra Club.
Unless natural gas prices go up, the future of new nuclear production may only occur in states, such as Georgia and North Carolina, that allow electric monopolies, said Christopher Muir, utilities analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Georgia and South Carolina are two states currently building plants.
Southern Company’s $8bn Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. 
The Vogtle Power Plant in Georgia, majority owned by Southern Company, will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. Southern Company’s share of the project is estimated at $8bn, and some estimates place the entire price tag at $21bn.
“Completing the new units at Plant Vogtle remains the best cost option for meeting Georgia’s future energy needs – once the new units come online they will put downward pressure on customer rates and provide reliable, carbon-free energy for 60 to 80 years,” said Craig Bell, spokesman for Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company.",1457,0.023660130718954252,0.6720261437908497,0.11124183006535947,1.3071895424836603e-4,1.3071895424836603e-4,0.0014379084967320263,0.017124183006535947,1.3071895424836603e-4,0.17267973856209148,0.0014379084967320263

For the past year and a half, the MS Estraden, which belongs to the Dutch-owned shipping company Bore, has been testing out the cylinders on its regular journey between Rotterdam and Teesport, on the north-east coast of the UK. The result: it has cut fuel costs by 6% (pdf).
“It’s hard to generalise because unlike many other technologies, the savings are dependent on the route sailed (and the weather conditions specific to that route), but the savings on large tankers and bulk carriers could be greater than 10%,” says Tristan Smith, shipping and climate change expert at UCL.
Smith has been following the MS Estraden and its wind cylinders trial with interest as he looks into ways shipping companies can cut their greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a thankless task at times, with shipping and climate change a largely mute topic among the media, politicians and NGOs.
Shipping brings us 90% of everything we buy and consume, yet most of us remain blind to both its role in our lives and its contribution to global climate emissions: currently around 3%. The industry has no targets for reducing emissions; the climate talks in Paris last year were skilfully negotiated with warnings that a cap on emissions for shipping would be a cap on global trade and growth.
On current projections, the sector could be contributing upwards of 6% (pdf) of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Although the UN agency that regulates shipping puts out glowing press releases, its only two policies so far are achieving little. There is an agreement for ships to record and report data on fuel consumption, but not until 2018 at the earliest, and rules to ensure new ships being built are more efficient.
“Recent new ships have regularly been achieving design improvements not because of the regulation, but because of market forces including an oversupply of ships forcing greater competition and increased pressure for owners to seek margins through efficiency,” says Smith. 
Shipping companies blame factors outside their control for their climate impact, in particular a tripling in demand for shipping over the past 40 years. However, as the MS Estraden shows, there are tangible options that shipping companies could pursue to reduce emissions if they wanted. Bore says it was “proud” to be the first company to demonstrate renewable energy-powered vessels and wanted to find ways to cut its environmental impact.
“It’s [shipping] a conservative industry,” says Tuomas Riski, CEO of Norsepower, the Finnish company that developed the wind-powered cylinders used on MS Estraden. Although he does now have interest from other shipping companies in Europe and Asia, the original funding for his research came from venture-capitalists rather than the shipping sector.
Another company pushing wind technology is the Germany-based SkySails. It has equipped five ships so far with automated kites to help propel them and cut fuel consumption. Despite average fuel savings of 2-3 tonnes a day, it has found it difficult to attract interest from ship companies.
“Many ship owners struggle to survive and there’s not much money for investing in solutions improving long-term profitability – ‘We don’t even know if we’re still there in five years’ is what we hear,” says Henning Kuehl, head of business development at SkySails.
“There’s also a structural problem slowing down the process: ship owners (who have to make the investment) often don’t pay for the fuel – that’s the charterer’s duty. The charterer on the other side doesn’t charter the ship for long enough a period to make low-carbon technologies pay back.” 
With a wariness about renewables, low fuel prices and little political incentive, the onus is on numerous trials to convince shipping companies of the benefit. “The sector is risk-adverse so expanding uptake requires a high burden of proof,” says Conor Walsh, research associate on shipping at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. “Most of the technologies at the moment are low-scale and not mainstream. There are not yet many in commercial use.
One fast-track solution could be for major users of cargo such as retailers and commodity companies to start insisting on the use of more efficient, low-carbon ships. This is starting to happen – Cargill, for example, says that where possible it refuses to charter the most polluting vessels – but doesn’t involve renewable technologies such as wind. 
Maersk, one of the few shipping companies to set itself targets for reducing emissions, says cost savings rather than consumer demand remains the main driving force. “There is a limit to how far we can go alone,” says John Kornerup Bang, Maersk’s lead adviser on climate change. “We need fair regulation and limits for the industry, otherwise there is a gap between the free ride of those doing nothing and us.” 
With no sign yet of any industry-wide emission reduction targets, Kuehl says the responsibility is on all of those involved in shipping to help the sector think long term. “The market is still quite opportunistic with charterers hopping from one vessel to the next, depending on which is the cheapest. To make a change, cargo owners, charterers and ship owners need to come to one table and work out long-term cooperations so that green shipping works for each party.”

It reveals a stark generational divide over whether to increase taxation, with under-45s much less supportive than those aged over 45.
The results suggest that public support for tax rises to fund the NHS, and the health service receiving a growing share of public spending, may be eroded in the coming years.
While overall 41% of the public believe taxes should go up to fund public services such as the NHS, just 33% of 18 to 24-year-olds and even fewer – 30% – of those aged between 25 and 44 agreed.
In contrast, backing is strongest among those aged 45-54 (42%), 55-64 (46%) and over 65 (54%).
Older age groups are also least likely to agree that “we should cut taxes and reduce spending on public services”. Only 8% of over-65s agree, whereas 21% of 25 to 34-year-olds think that should happen.
The split between older and younger adults emerged in a survey of public attitudes by Populus. It carried out online polling of 2,096 UK adults for the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA).
“The NHS can’t afford to keep mitigating our failure to invest in what leads to good health: a welfare system that promotes economic security; investment in early years, education and skills; and better quality jobs for all,” said Ed Cox, the RSA’s director of public services and communities.
Younger people have very different priorities than older age groups, Cox stressed. “Aside from a shared commitment to tackling inequality there is neither a clear consensus on tax increases nor agreement on how any extra money is spent.
“The younger generations who’ll pay for increased spending see climate change and technological adaptation as greater challenges than the ageing society,” he added.
Social care illustrates the chasm of opinion between the age groups. While 54% of over-65s see increasing taxation as the best solution, fewer than one in four of those aged 18 to 44 agree.
A third of 18 to 24-year-olds think that much greater use should be made of volunteers, while just 14% of those of pensionable age concur.
Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, stressed that while volunteers play a hugely important role, “they cannot and should not be asked to replace the vital work of trained care workers” and could not plug the gaps in the social care workforce.
“Social care, just like the NHS, is an essential public service providing highly skilled support to people who are often living with complex needs or coming to the end of their life.
“It needs sustainable funding, a well-trained and committed workforce and the capacity to work closely with health, housing and other vital services. As the majority of people in this survey recognise, putting funding on a sustainable footing is a vital first step.”
Asked which policy areas the government should focus on over the next decade to make the UK a better country, those aged 45 and over identified inequality, the ageing society and social isolation and mental health.
However, again under-45s offered a different set of priorities. While isolation did feature in their top three priorities, climate change was the biggest (48%) area of interest for 18 to 24-year-olds and also mentioned by those aged 25 to 44. For those under 45 international relations and Brexit were also key issues.
Cox added that the findings showed that “traditional left-right politics is being flipped on its head, as under-45s back lower taxes and a smaller state, despite overwhelmingly voting Labour in the last election, while Conservative-leaning voters over 65 back higher taxes and spending”.",611,3.344481605351171e-4,0.0070234113712374585,0.17090301003344482,3.344481605351171e-4,0.07391304347826087,0.04381270903010033,0.174247491638796,0.21438127090301,0.04381270903010033,0.27123745819397993

It began last year when Monsanto started looking for a partner, trying three times (unsuccessfully) to link up with Syngenta. By the end of 2015, Dow and DuPont announced they were teaming up. Subject to regulatory approval, the new $130bn company – DowDuPont – plans to split into three parts, one of which will focus exclusively on agricultural chemicals and seeds and is set to command a hefty market share. It is estimated DowDuPont could account for around 40% of the corn and soybean seed market in the US.
In February this year, ChemChina announced a $43bn purchase of Syngenta, bolstering ChemChina’s genetically engineered seed capacity and giving it the largest slice of the agricultural chemical market. The remaining players – Monsanto, Bayer and BASF – are now under pressure to join the mega-merger dance, with talks on various potential permutations reportedly under way. 
These proposed corporate mega-mergers are the result of pressure from financial investors. Years of low interest rates since the financial crisis have made corporate borrowing cheap and easy. But the onset of low agricultural commodity prices and faltering economic growth in emerging economies has weakened demand for commercial seeds and crop protection chemicals, making it harder for agribusiness firms to generate high returns for their shareholders, and to pay their debts.
Concerned about excessive borrowing and weak performance, investors have increasingly put pressure on agribusiness managers to improve their performance. In the case of Dow and DuPont, individual activist investors – each managing enormous hedge funds for wealthy clients – pushed hard on these firms to cut costs through restructuring. Essentially, mergers and acquisitions have been the tools of choice to attempt to placate restless investors.
Regulators in the countries in which these firms are based are scrutinising the details of these deals, deciding whether to allow them to proceed. No doubt they are reviewing the mergers looking for evidence regarding traditional concerns about the effects of corporate consolidation – that it stifles competition, reduces innovation and can lead to a loss of tax revenue if the firm relocates its headquarters. These concerns merit close consideration, but there is so much more at stake.
For starters, mergers are likely to lead to higher costs of inputs for farmers. Already, the seed and chemical industries are highly concentrated. In 2013, the top six firms controlled 75% of the agrochemical market and 63% of the commercial seed market. If the number of firms drops, it will be that much easier for them to raise prices. 
Consolidation in the agribusiness industry also tends to concentrate political power as giant firms lobby governments to shape the rules of the food system in ways that support their interests. According to the non-profit, ETC Group (pdf), small-scale farmers feed around 70% of the world’s population, and do so mainly with seeds saved from one harvest to the next rather than commercially purchased seed. Changes in government policies that favour big corporations’ desire for more large-scale industrial agriculture will directly threaten small farmers’ livelihoods.
Further spread of the industrial agricultural model is also likely to have devastating ecological effects. Large-scale, chemical-based monoculture farming is recognised as a major contributor to both climate change and biodiversity loss, problems that pose significant threats to long-term food security. 
If the proposed mega-mergers proceed, the food system will face profound changes in the name of increased short-term financial returns for relatively few investors. Ironically, there is little evidence to show that corporate consolidation is even economically productive in the long run. 
A short-term financial boost for a handful of investors is hardly justification for allowing the mega-mergers when they threaten farmer livelihoods, the environment and long-term food security.

The leaders of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the European Union encouraged all countries to join them in eliminating “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” within a decade. 
“Given the fact that energy production and use account for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, we recognise the crucial role that the energy sector has to play in combatting climate change,” said the leaders’ declaration, issued at the end their summit in Japan. The pledge first entered into G7 (then known as G8) declarations in 2009 but has until now lacked a firm timeline.
Shelagh Whitley, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, called it an “historic day” but said 2020 was a more appropriate date if governments were serious about their commitments to the global climate deal agreed in Paris in December.
Across the G7, subsidies are already falling, assisted by falling commodity prices. A notable exception is the UK, which increased subsidies by opening up new tax breaks for North Sea oil producers. Japan has been criticised for funding new coal projects, both at home and abroad.
“We already see [some in] the G7 going in the wrong direction since Paris. Just because they are saying this [about fossil fuel subsidies], it’s not a fait accompli,” said Whitley. Canada also recently extended some subsidies for natural gas.
The G7 joins the leaders of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank, who have previously called for an end to assistance for fossil fuel projects.
The statement did not define precisely what the G7 consider to be a subsidy. The word “inefficient” in the G7 text indicates subsidies that distort energy markets. The OECD estimates that this type of support for fossil fuels within its member states is $160-200bn (£109-136bn) each year. 
But when the cost of damage from pollution and climate change is factored in, the International Monetary Fund has estimated that support increases to a staggering $5.3tn a year, or $10m per minute. This is more than the total global spend on human health.
The OECD approach to measuring subsidies is likely to be the yardstick applied by the G7. The US and China recently asked the OECD to oversee a peer review of each other’s subsidy programme.
Whitley said another significant change from the G7 was the excision of a past phrase that focused on subsidies for the “consumption” of fuels. She said this meant the G7 could target subsidies for exploration as well, not just the end use.",442,4.8780487804878054e-4,0.6004878048780488,4.8780487804878054e-4,4.8780487804878054e-4,4.8780487804878054e-4,4.8780487804878054e-4,0.3565853658536585,4.8780487804878054e-4,0.02975609756097561,0.01024390243902439

Like so many individuals and institutions, it was pushed out by high rent.
The Club, the US’s largest grassroots environmental organization, will be fine in its new home across the bay in Oakland; it’s San Francisco I worry about.
Contemporary gentrification is an often violent process by which a complex and diverse urban environment becomes more homogeneous and exclusionary. It does to neighborhoods and cities what climate change is doing to the earth: driving out fragile and deeply rooted species, and pushing the poor past the brink.
Think of climate change as a globalized form of gentrification, reducing complex environments, uprooting species and cultures, punishing the poor and rewarding the rich – or at least leaving them out of the purges. After all, the reason why climate change continues unabated long after most of the world has acknowledged its seriousness is that it’s profitable for some, notably fossil fuel companies, and not threatening enough to the people in power. You can buy your way out of a lot of trouble, if watching the suffering and annihilation of others doesn’t trouble you. 
Thanks to climate change, there is already immense suffering and loss, of places, species, crops, homes. The poor are often the people deeply rooted in place, whether they’re fisherfolk in the Mekong Delta (due to go underwater from rising seas) or farmers in desertifying Africa or India, where a horrific heatwave and drought killed at least 300 last month and left 330 million without enough water. The rich can always move on if their beachfront home floods or the weather in the Azores or Miami becomes unbearable, as it did last month in Cambodia during “the most intense heatwave ever observed in south-east Asia”, where the temperature reached 108.7F (42.6C) for the first time ever recorded. 
Climate change produces famine, but the elite won’t starve. Billionaire investment leader Warren Buffett wrote to his flock at Berkshire Hathaway that “as a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.”
This is what I thought about when I heard that the Sierra Club left San Francisco last week. I’m sure you’ve heard that the boom in Silicon Valley has brought in hordes of well-paid tech workers, creating wildly escalating housing costs and scarcity and pushing out many longtime residents. Silicon Valley’s well-paid workforce is disproportionately white, male and young. Schoolteachers, nurses, mechanics and other vital workers are being pushed out of an increasingly homogeneous central Bay Area, and homelessness is an escalating crisis.
Similar gentrification crises afflict cities around the world. For me, this matters because cities have been our brains trusts, our radical thinktanks, our revolutionary incubators. What will they be when no one can afford them unless they’re born rich or fall in line with the industries that provide sky-high salaries? 
“It’s sad to be leaving a place that’s been so important to the Sierra Club for such a long time,” Michael Brune, the Sierra Club’s executive director since 2010, told me. “The revolutionary spirit, people who lead lives that are wild and free: some of that seems to be leaving. It would’ve cost us between half and three quarters of a million [dollars] more to stay. There’s no way to justify spending that when we have a planet to save.”
The club was founded with a mission to foster mountaineering expeditions and protect the Sierra Nevada mountains but morphed into a ferocious combatant over environmental issues around the country. Environmentalism itself has changed colossally in the past century, from putting fences around the nicest places to recognizing that you have to defend the whole system. Which the club does with vigor, playing a role at the Paris climate conference last December and at the protests surrounding it. 
The Paris conference made clear what the conflict over climate change is really about. The poor nations, from the Philippines to Bolivia to Bangladesh, are fighting to protect life, for human beings and for the ecosystems they depend upon. Many in the wealthy countries are fighting to protect wealth, for the fossil fuel companies, investors and elites. Distilled down, the message from the global north is often something like, “it’s you or our bottom line, and sorry, it’s not you”. 
Climate change will cost us all in the end, or at least will cost ordinary people in the wealthy countries. Trillions of dollars will be lost, but the burden will be borne – as with wars and other avoidable wastes – by ordinary people, the same people who will gain jobs and other benefits from a swift departure from fossil fuel.
My city is now an unbearable place. Most people who aren’t wealthy feel they have no future here, and those of us who are securely housed dread staying in place as the people we love get pushed out around us. The racial injustice that has included police murders of young men of color, most recently an indigenous man who had become homeless in 2012. It also includes widespread evictions, the loss of cultural institutions, and a sense of being pushed out, devalued, criminalized and threatened. A place long considered a utopia of sorts has become a textbook dystopia. 
The week the Sierra Club left San Francisco, five people entered the second week of a hunger strike outside a police station to protest against killings they linked to racism and gentrification. The police station was on Valencia Street in the Mission district, on the same block where upscale men could get a $50 shave, across the street from where you could still get a $3 taco at El Toro, the old taqueria owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa. That week, a 25-year-old who had just moved to the city wrote in USA Today about all the apps you could use to get everything delivered by faceless minions and never have to go out and meet the neighbors, which was OK because you could also organize to meet like-minded people online. She wrote, “I had burritos delivered from Pancho Villa twice before I ever stepped in the well-known staple in my Mexican-infused neighborhood.” 
The week the Sierra Club left the city where it had been founded and based for 124 years, the progressives on San Francisco’s board of supervisors proposed to fine unregistered Airbnb listings, noting that 6,000 former residences had been converted to illegal hotels, contributing to the city’s shrinking housing stock. That means that long-term residents, with histories, networks of relationships and commitments, are being replaced by transients who will never plant roots, know the neighbors or serve the community.
That week, the CEO of the Silicon Valley firm Invoca posted on Facebook to describe how he would punish the poor Latinos selling produce in his upscale neighborhood, “If that was my house, I would go out there and make their life miserable. I would do whatever it took to make them leave.” A lot of people were already miserable in this region afflicted by the runaway gentrification of a city in the grip of a boom.
The climate justice movement is a movement to keep the whole Earth for all of us. It’s a movement to recognize that we depend on the health of the non-human world, and that we are all in this together. The Sierra Club’s departure from San Francisco reminds us that loss of diversity impoverishes environments, and that what we too often call wealth enriches a few but impoverishes many when it drives out species, communities, cultural continuities, idealism and altruism.",1282,0.14352331606217616,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.13488773747841104,0.10207253886010363,1.7271157167530226e-4,1.7271157167530226e-4,0.07789291882556132,0.01226252158894646,0.13488773747841104,0.3939550949913644

Bill Gates has called the selling off of coal, oil and gas stocks a “false solution” to climate change, but the known investments of his foundation in major fossil fuel companies has fallen by 85% since 2014.
The foundation, which has spent many billions of dollars improving global health, sold its $187m stake in BP between September and December 2015, according to recent regulatory filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
It had previously dumped its entire $824m holding in ExxonMobil. BP posted a record $6.5bn annual loss in February while ExxonMobil is under investigation about whether it lied in the past to investors about the threat of climate change.
The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign has called on the Gates foundation to divest its $40bn endowment from fossil fuels.
Climate change poses the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, according to doctors, and to avoid catastrophic impacts, most known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. If the world’s governments succeed as promised and halt global warming, those reserves could become worthless, and divestment campaigners argue there are both financial and moral reasons for divestment.
“We are thrilled that the Gates foundation continues to divest from fossil fuel stocks, but it’s time to divest the rest. Investing in oil companies is completely inconsistent with the Gates foundation mission to ensure that everybody has the chance to live a healthy, productive life,” said Alec Connon, an organiser for the Gates Divest campaign, a coalition of scores of social justice groups, politicians and faith leaders in Washington State, where the Foundation is based.
Mike McGinn, who as mayor of Seattle in 2013 was the first mayor to commit a city to divestment, said: “They’re moving their financial capital - now it’s time to use their moral capital and publicly commit to divestment. 
“By taking a public stand, Bill and Melinda Gates could help change the debate and speed up the international response to global warming.” 

The Gates foundation does not comment on its investments. Public records show that at the start of 2014, the Foundation held $1.4bn of investments in major coal, oil and gas companies. The sell-off of its BP and ExxonMobil stocks leaves just $200m of those stocks.
It is unknown whether some or all of the remaining fossil fuel stocks have been sold, as the foundation only has to declare holdings of over $100m in US-related companies to the SEC. New fossil fuel investments may have been made below that threshold or in undeclared companies.
An analysis in November found that the Gates foundation would have been $1.9bn better off if it had divested from fossil fuels in 2012.
The world’s second biggest health charity after the Gates foundation is the UK-based Wellcome Trust and the Guardian’s campaign also asks it to divest. The trust lost an estimated £175m on its investments in fossil fuel companies in the year to August 2015, according to a Guardian analysis. But in December, it was revealed that Wellcome had defied divestment campaigners and increased its investments in coal, oil and gas over the year.

But for the 30-year-old leader of a political party, the Netherlands’ youngest ever, it was not a bad election.
GreenLeft was the big winner in Wednesday’s poll, leaping from four MPs to 14 in the 150-seat parliament, topping the bill in Amsterdam and overtaking the stricken social democratic PvdA to become the largest party of the left nationally.
As traditional left and centre-left parties suffer across Europe in countries including Italy, France and Britain, the Dutch GreenLeft, formed 25 years ago by a merger of communists, pacifists, evangelicals and radicals, is growing fast.
A large part of its success is down to Klaver, a boyish figure in jeans, open-necked shirt and rolled-up sleeves who was first elected as an MP at the age of 24 and took over the leadership of GreenLeft in May 2015. Since then, under the “Jessiah”, as he is nicknamed, the party has gained 7,000 new members, nearly half of them under 30.
Something of a throwback to classic 1970s Dutch ideals of openness and radicalism, Klaver has a Moroccan father and a mother of Indonesian descent. The far-right populism of Geert Wilders, rather than Muslim immigration, is the real threat to Dutch culture and traditions, he has repeatedly said.
Properly leftwing parties in Europe had to fight the rise of the far right by standing up for their ideals, he said on Wednesday.
“What I would say to all my leftwing friends in Europe: don’t try to fake the populace,” he said. “Stand for your principles. Be straight. Be pro-refugee. Be pro-European. We’re gaining momentum in the polls. You can stop populism.”
In the Netherlands’ fragmented political scene, Klaver hoped to win enough seats to help form a government without the centre-right, liberal VVD party of the outgoing prime minister, Mark Rutte, the winner of Wednesday’s poll.
Klaver insisted on Thursday that should still be an option given GreenLeft’s particularly strong performance, although he conceded the Dutch political landscape was now “extremely complicated”.
Perhaps more likely – and he did not rule it out – is that he will be asked to lend support to a centre-right coalition so it can secure a majority. That, though, might force him to choose between his ideals and entering government.
The party is unashamedly pro-European and campaigned on a mix of environmental and old-fashioned leftwing policies: tighter bonus rules, zero tax avoidance, sharing of refugees across the EU and obligatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
Perhaps understandably, its message resonates particularly strongly with young urban voters. Besides Amsterdam, GreenLeft also performed well in university cities such as Groningen, Utrecht and Nijmegen.
“Our message speaks to the population of Amsterdam, and that’s to do with the fact that Amsterdam is a metropolis with lots of young, well educated people,” said Rutger Groot Wassink, the leader of the party’s group on Amsterdam city council.
GreenLeft is the main opposition group on the council behind the progressive liberals of D66 – who also fared well in Wednesday’s parliamentary election. “What we share is a very open and tolerant view of the world, socially and culturally, whether about abortion, euthanasia or the soft drugs policy,” Groot Wassink said. 
“But I think the reason we’ve overtaken D66 is that we have a social-economic message of sharing fairly. In a city like Amsterdam, where inequality is rising, integration is an ongoing process, but we’ve shown it can be dealt with differently.”
Klaver built his strong following through social media, town-hall style meetings and finally rallies, which were consistently among the campaign’s largest – including an Amsterdam meeting that drew an audience of more than 5,000, plus 5,000 more following live on Facebook.
Inspired by Barack Obama’s US campaigns, the party’s election operation was aimed at breaking the mould of generally staid and often dry Dutch electioneering by creating a mass movement behind a charismatic personality.
Groot Wassink said the success could be a blueprint for green parties in countries such as Britain. “The British system is complicated, but I think the Greens ought to be able to make an impact. People in cities understand the wellbeing of our planet is important, that we need to get off fossil fuels, organise the economy differently.”
Targeting the younger generation has its drawbacks: they turn out in smaller numbers in elections, the councillor said. But he said the party had also won sympathy from more traditional leftwing voters in a city that was a PvdA stronghold for two generations.
GreenLeft benefited hugely from the collapse of the PvdA, which was severely punished by voters after pushing through a series of unpopular measures as part of the ruling coalition, such as raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. 
Backing also came from voters concerned about climate change in a low-lying country exposed to its dangers. Party activist Carolijn Hofte, 56, previously voted for liberal parties such as the VVD and D66, but said the environment was too pressing an issue to be ignored. 
GreenLeft’s focus on social equality and renewable energy was the right one for the future, Hofte said. “I don’t think the current government has divided things equally,” she said. 
“The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and people on the lower end of the scale are being forgotten. But the other thing is the climate. We need to do something about it – we really can’t stand still any longer.”",904,2.320185614849188e-4,2.320185614849188e-4,0.03039443155452436,2.320185614849188e-4,0.18816705336426912,2.320185614849188e-4,0.10464037122969838,0.2740139211136891,0.048955916473317866,0.35290023201856147

Three out of four (72%) of the world’s biggest meat and fish companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions, despite the fact that, as the report points out, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is clear that the meat and dairy industries have remained out of public scrutiny in terms of their significant climate impact. For this to change, these companies must be held accountable for the emissions and they must have credible, independently verifiable emissions reductions strategy,” said Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy European office. 
The new Coller FAIRR Protein Producers Index has examined the environmental and social commitments of 60 of the world’s largest meat and fish producers and found that more than half are failing to properly document their impact, despite their central role in our lives and societies.
Many of the names in the index will be unfamiliar, but their consolidated revenues of $300bn cover around one-fifth of the global livestock and aquaculture market – roughly one in every five burgers, steaks or fish. 
The companies looked at by the index include giants like the Australian Agricultural Company, which has the biggest cattle herd in the world; the Chinese WH Group, the largest global pork company; or the US’s Sandersons, which processes more than 10 million chickens a week.
Many of them run vertically integrated systems, sourcing meat from contracted farmers around the world, processing it themselves through their own slaughter and packing houses and then selling on to frontline, more familiar companies such as McDonalds, Walmart, Nestle and Danone.
But a close examination by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) group has shown that, despite their critical part in our food system, these companies appear to be neglecting some of their social responsibilities. 
The food system, according to FAIRR, is “very sensitive to changing public sentiment”, and really large sums of investor money in the sector are often at risk due to little-understood risks. The organisation, founded by financier Jeremy Coller in 2015, aims to shed greater light on these risks.
Animal welfare, water scarcity, deforestation and working conditions were some of the areas in which the 60 largest protein-producing companies around the world were assessed. The index looked at self-declared information from each company, and set a wide range of key performance indicators such as targets for deforestation reduction, a policy on antibiotic reduction, or water exposer of supply chains. Overall 60% were found to be “either not managing critical risks or are failing to disclose basic information”.
“The findings from this first index create cause for concern,” said the report’s introduction. “There is still a worrying lack of ESG [environmental, social and governance] data availability and disclosure … despite the sector’s myriad sustainability impacts.”
Climate change emerged as a particular concern. Despite the fact that, according to the report, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, almost 72% of companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions. Some 19 companies received the lowest possible mark in this section, including Australia Agricultural Company, Cal-Maine (a US company which reportedly produced 1bn eggs in 2017), Russian Cherkizovo and Indian Venky’s. This, the report argues, may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy”. The Guardian approached these companies for comment but received no response. 
 Studies over the last decade have repeatedly shown that the production of red meat is energy and water-intensive compared to the production of most grains and vegetables. But many government officials appear to be reluctant to suggest that consumers should reduce their meat consumption.
Antibiotic use also stood out. Antibiotic resistance has soared in recent decades and is now considered one of the biggest public health threats facing the world. The role of farming and food production in spreading resistant bacteria has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as growing evidence points to a direct threat to human health from veterinary overuse of antibiotics on farms.
Despite this, there has been a “widespread failure to respond” to the crisis, the report says. The report says that 77% of the sector - 46 companies worth an estimated $239bn - rank “high risk” on antibiotic stewardship, with “little or no measures in place to reduce excessive use of antibiotics”.
Abigail Herron, global head of responsible investment, Aviva Investors, said: “Our research shows that three in four of these companies are ignoring the calls from regulators, health professionals and the financial community to manage and reduce their use of antibiotics. That failure puts both global public health and their business models at risk.”
 
Indian poultry giant Venky’s is among the companies ranked as “high risk” on antibiotics. Sanderson Farms, one of the US’s largest poultry producers, is also given bottom-tier ranking.
Venky’s was recently found by an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to be advertising colistin, a so-called “last resort” antibiotic, for sale as a growth promoter in India, one of five pharma companies found to be doing the same.
Deforestation is another area in which many companies are falling short. A recent analysis by Forest 500 found that despite cattle production being the biggest driver of tropical production globally, only 17% of assessed cattle companies had a policy addressing forest production. And the Coller Index finds that of the 24 companies processing beef and dairy (where deforestation is a particular risk), only one is assessed as “low risk”.
 “From an investment point of view, it is not only this $300bn group of companies at risk but the wider multi-trillion dollar global food supply chain ... Investors sit at the top of the chain as ultimate owners of these listed businesses. They need to use their influence as responsible stewards of these assets to start a dialogue on best practice and encourage a race to the top to build a more sustainable food system,” said Aarti Ramachandran, head of research and corporate engagement at FAIRR.
“A major, systemic change is needed in the way we source protein if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, habitat loss and water stress. This can only be achieved if businesses and policymakers, working with the latest food technologies and scientific advice, collaborate to create a sustainable and nutritious food revolution that meets tomorrow’s demand,” said Emily Farnworth, Head of Climate Change Initiatives, World Economic Forum.
“It’s always worth remembering that there is no such thing as cheap meat—these industries have been subsidised for years by the public because we pay for their environmental pollution, public health costs that they do not account for in their business model. This is where governments need to step in,” said Sharma.

A 57% plunge in the country’s olive harvest – the worst in 25 years – sparked protests by thousands of Italian farmers wearing gilet arancioni – orange vests – in Rome earlier this month.
Olive trees across the Mediterranean have been hit by freak events that mirror climate change predictions – erratic rainfalls, early spring frosts, strong winds and summer droughts.
Prof Riccardo Valentini, a director of the Euro-Mediterranean Center for climate change, said: “There are clear observational patterns that point to these types of weather extremes as the main drivers of [lower] food productivity.”
He added: “Freezing temperatures in the Mediterranean are anomalous for us. In any direction the extremes are important and indeed, they are predicted by climate change scenarios.”
Several reports by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) “all point to these climatic extremes as one of the major impacts of climate change”, he said. “We know there will be more extremes and anomalies in the future.”
Valentini said that sudden extremes in any direction – warming or cooling, freezing or drying – can harm plant development. “Three or four days of 40C temperatures in summer, or 10 days without rain in spring – even two days of freezing temperatures in spring – are more important than the average for the year,” he said.
Average temperatures in the Mediterranean have already risen by 1.4C above pre-industrial levels – compared with a global average of about 1C – and precipitation has fallen by 2.5%.
In the past 18 months, Italy has experienced summer droughts, autumn floods and spring ice waves.
Olive trees are weakened by these kinds of weather shocks and, even if they recover, are left more vulnerable to outbreaks of the xylella fastidiosa bacterium and olive fly infestations, which have hit farmers in Italy and Greece, Valentini said.
Italy’s Coldiretti farmers’ union estimates that the cost of the olive oil collapse this year has already reached €1bn.
“The government promised a solution but it has not given any more resources for the olive farmers,” a Coldiretti spokesman said, adding there was “no plan for [addressing] climate change and olive oil production either.”
He said: “We have had demonstrations in front of parliament already and we are waiting for government action.” The spokesman added that if it did not materialise, “there could be more protests”.
Beyond Italy, the European commission has projected 2018-19 olive harvests to drop by 20% in Portugal and 42% in Greece, although industry sources said final figures there could be significantly worse.
Greek farmers were devastated by extreme drought and then heavy rains, which acted as a “trigger event” for olive fly infestations, according to Valentini.
Vasilis Pyrgiotis, the chair of the Copa Cogeca farming union’s olives working group, said: “the big issue is not necessarily the quantity but the quality. Most Greek olive oil is considered ‘extra virgin’ but it is not certain, as time goes by, that this will continue.”
Olive oil has to meet organoleptic criteria (such as acidity levels) before it can be classed as extra virgin, and these are affected by growing conditions.
“The problem this year was because of fly attacks but also the gloeosporium olivarum fungus,” Pyrgiotis said. “This year’s olives are not as good as they used to be. In the longer term, we face the possibility that they may not be considered as extra virgin oil because of analysis issues.”
Olive trees follow a pattern known as alternate bearing, with bad years routinely followed by good. This year, the EU expects Europe’s overall olive basket to be saved by a surge from its biggest producer, Spain.
A trend there towards super intensive plantations may partly mitigate climate change impacts, according to Valentini – but at a cost to traditional farming and biodiversity. Fast-growing, high-density olive plantations might be more drought-resistant but water resources could also be limited by these plantations, he said.
“It will change the rural landscape from older growth olive trees to more intensive plantations,” he added. “People in the south of Italy are beginning to move in that direction. I don’t like it but I understand it is an adaptation.”
A Met Office spokesman said that in future, the combined effect of pests, disease and climate change on global agriculture could be “potentially devastating”.",722,0.5310055865921788,2.793296089385475e-4,0.08128491620111732,0.24050279329608937,0.0030726256983240226,0.017039106145251396,0.05893854748603353,0.06452513966480447,0.0030726256983240226,2.793296089385475e-4

Mark Leopold draws parallels with a visit by Idi Amin, and Chris Osman argues that the best way to protest about Trump’s trip, is not to protest at all","The UK government’s approach to both this week’s Nato summit (Report, 7 July), and the visit of President Trump, is symptomatic of its counterproductive stance on national and international security.
Recent efforts by the Ministry of Defence to use the Nato summit to secure further budget increases are misguided. Instead of increasing our safety, heavy spending on aggressive military capabilities and power projection is exacerbating global tensions. By the same token, turning a blind eye to Trump’s abusive and degrading rhetoric and actions in the hope of shoring up a superpower alliance deepens global insecurity.
If the UK wants to make a genuine contribution to security, the government needs to invest far more in addressing the underlying causes of global insecurity, such as economic inequality, climate change and poor governance. It should be using its diplomatic clout to increase international focus on these issues, as well as supporting local actors in concerted efforts to bring about durable political resolution of the conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Israel-Palestine and elsewhere. Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are not soft options; failure to make progress on these critical challenges of our time only results in more insecurity for everyone, both in the UK and overseas.
We therefore call for an urgent and comprehensive rethink of the government’s approach to security and international relations, based on systematic commitment to its declared values of human dignity, human rights, freedom, democracy and equality.  The UK’s security alliances need to work for the common good of all the world’s people.Celia McKeonCoordinator, Rethinking Security
• Mrs May is surely right that the majority of British people understand the “importance of the UK-US alliance” (Report, 7 July).  However, that is certainly not an alliance with the opinions and actions of the current president and his administration. Thousands of British people would want to be aligned with those in the United States who are protesting against the huge arsenal of nuclear weapons which the US not only maintains but which is being developed; those fighting to preserve the Environmental Protection Agency and stand up against the destruction of the environment by the climate change-denying president; with those working against the money and resource being put into developing and producing more and more advanced technological weapons to line the pockets of the huge military manufacturers. Our sympathies are with those women and men in the US who are prepared to take non-violent direct action to stem the tide of racism, misogyny, militarism and cruelty of their current leaders.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester
• You report that President Trump will be spending only a couple of days in London, meeting the Queen and prime minister, before being flown to Scotland for a “private visit”, for the remainder of his trip. The Foreign Office may be following precedent. Almost exactly 47 years ago, on 12 July 1971, a close British ally with a somewhat unsavoury reputation visited the UK, and was given two days in London, including talks with the monarch and PM.  He then flew to Scotland for two days including some shopping, sea swimming and military ceremonies. His name? President Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Mark LeopoldHove, East Sussex
• Mr Trump has been invited to this country by our government. He should therefore be treated with civility. He has, however, shown himself to be self-serving, ignorant, vulgar and mendacious. He does not deserve our attention. Many of his actions and statements deserve contempt.
The best response is to ignore him as much as possible, with minimal publicity and absolutely no demonstrations. He feeds off adulation and will enjoy the attention which demonstrations will provide.Chris OsmanOxford

The prime minister confirmed on Monday the government would spend $56m in an effort to progress a new 1,200MW interconnector as part of Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and he also sent a strong hint he will back Malcolm Turnbull’s pet project, adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity at Snowy Hydro.
The Tasmanian project is a plan to double the state’s renewable energy capacity by developing pumped hydro energy storage, building windfarms and upgrading existing generation assets. Fourteen pumped hydro sites have been earmarked across the state with a combined potential generation capacity of up to 4,800 megawatts.
Under the plan, renewable energy would be exported to the mainland if a planned second interconnector goes ahead.
The additional generation projects and transmission infrastructure, as well as potential action to assist the rollout of electric vehicles, were flagged during a speech in Melbourne in which Morrison promised to rebadge and top up funding for the existing emissions reduction fund to the tune of $2bn over 10 years as part of a climate policy pivot.
The prime minister, who has faced internal pressure from MPs to give them something constructive to sell to voters on climate change, said the government was committed to addressing the challenge, and insisted a package of measures will ensure Australia meets its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
One of the measures the government has factored in to help meet the 2030 target is a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030).
The government’s policy shift was panned by Labor, the Greens, a range of climate experts and environmental groups. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said Labor would scrap the fund if it won the next federal election.
“This has been their policy for the last five years, with exactly the same annual amount put into it as Scott Morrison has promised for the future, and yet we’ve seen carbon pollution go up year upon year, projected to continue to go up all the way to 2030,” Butler said on Monday. “This is a failed policy”.
Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the director of Climate Analytics, said the emissions reduction fund was “a failed policy”, with all independent analysis showing it had not reduced emissions to the extent the government claimed.
“They certainly have not shown up in the national emissions, which continue to increase,” he said.
Hare said the amount of annual funding proposed by Morrison halved what the original policy provided under Abbott. He said the government had also taken no steps to rectify problems with the scheme, including that emitters were currently able to use the safeguard mechanism to increase their emissions.
“The bigger issue is there’s no way the Australian taxpayer can pay for the emissions reductions needed, and nor should they,” Hare said.
“The polluter-pays principle needs to be applied and that means a carbon pricing system would enable companies to make an investment in their production that would benefit taxpayers and the bottom line.”
The Australian Conservation Foundation said the emissions reduction fund had done nothing to cut carbon pollution since its introduction and it was difficult to see how continuing with the same policy would lead to a different result.
“There are serious questions about the governance, effectiveness and value for money of the emissions reduction fund that a new name won’t fix,” Gavan McFadzean, the ACF’s climate change and clean energy program director, said.
“A responsible climate policy must include a whole-of-government and whole-economy approach to reducing pollution, but today’s announcement contains nothing about the energy sector or transport or agriculture or major industry – nothing about cutting pollution from the most polluting parts of our economy.”
Neneh Darwin, a campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said topping up the fund was a choice by the government to do “as close to nothing” on climate policy as possible.
“First step in fixing the climate crisis is powering past coal – but the government is doing every single thing it can think of to delay that, including trying to actively prop up the industry by throwing as much taxpayer money at it as they can”, Darwin said.
The Investor Group on Climate Change, which has been focused on the financial risks associated with climate change, said by continuing with the same policy the government was not addressing the serious economic risks climate change exposed Australia to.
“There is a significant gap between the government’s current target and the objectives of the Paris agreement. This is of great concern for investors, as global warming above 1.5-2C would have large and detrimental impacts on global economies, society and investment portfolios,” the group’s chief executive Emma Herd said.
Herd said the government needed to close the gap between its long-term Paris commitments and the current policies urgently. She said investors were increasingly worried about climate change and would keep pushing governments to adopt policies that enabled a smooth transition to a net zero emissions economy.
“The government’s support for investigation into stronger network connection with Tasmania and large scale energy storage is important,” she said.
“This work should be undertaken in the context of the energy market operator’s Integrated System Plan and embedded within a strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the electricity sector.”",914,2.2675736961451248e-4,0.27687074829931974,0.016099773242630386,2.2675736961451248e-4,0.6419501133786849,2.2675736961451248e-4,0.063718820861678,2.2675736961451248e-4,2.2675736961451248e-4,2.2675736961451248e-4

One recent study may offer an interesting clue, because American scientists stood the argument on its head and looked at places across the globe that will probably enjoy more pleasant weather with climate change.
For Britain, northern Europe and North America there will be more days of mild weather, defined as 18 to 30C, with low humidity and little rain – the sort of weather which by most people’s accounts would be most agreeable. Parts of southern England, for example, will get an extra 10 to 15 days of mild weather a year by the end of this century. It’s not entirely good news, because the mild days will tend to come in spring and autumn, while the summers will grow hotter and more humid. 
Many tropical regions will get decreases in mild days thanks to rising heat and humidity, according to the study in the journal Climatic Change – hugely important as mild days help to break up heatwaves which exacerbate health and air pollution problems.
Some places are already enjoying noticeably milder days, and this may help explain some of the lingering scepticism about climate change. Opinion polls show that if people see their local climate growing more pleasant, that leads to more scepticism about climate change. After all, what’s all the fuss about rising temperatures if things feel fine in your own backyard? 
To put it another way, people often trust the evidence of their own eyes rather than expert opinion. So, perhaps arguments about the climate need to be tailored for specific regions of the world.",276,0.5432203389830508,8.474576271186442e-4,8.474576271186442e-4,8.474576271186442e-4,8.474576271186442e-4,0.08559322033898305,8.474576271186442e-4,8.474576271186442e-4,8.474576271186442e-4,0.3652542372881356

(Bowie died on 10 January, in case you’re just now waking up from a very long nap. If so: good job!) In Five Years, the first song on his most famous album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, he imagines what it would be like to learn that the world was ending.
It’s one my favorite songs of his, and I’ve listened to it often these past weeks. But I can’t relate to the sentiment, exactly, because Tuesday, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced, using the “Doomsday Clock” as an indicator, that as far as they can tell, the world is no closer to ending than it was last year – though it’s also no farther away.
The SSBBAS was started in 1945 by scientists involved with the Manhattan Project with the express intent of gauging, and reporting, just how close mankind was to wiping itself out with nuclear weapons (and has since added “the changing energy landscape, climate change and emerging technologies,” to its list of concerns). Midnight on the Doomsday Clock, as you might have guessed, means the end of the world. We were three minutes to midnight last year and that’s where we remain. It’s not as close as we’ve ever been – the clock struck two back in 1953, when the US and Russia were both testing Hydrogen bombs – but certainly too close for comfort.
There’s a big part of me, though, that says, Who cares? (Likely a reaction that many of you are having to reading this very article!)
All those years after taking a first philosophy class and reading Nietzsche and having it blow your mind and then finding out that he really wasn’t so terrific after all, and all that listening to the Doors and later learning the same about them, the nihilist argument carries. So what if the world is ending? Is that really so bad? 
The world disappoints us in so many ways. People are stupid and cruel and life is full of pain and misery. We kill each other and we’re killing the planet we live on. Would it really be a net negative for everything to come to a full, abrupt stop? 
This week I stepped into a puddle of slush that was deeper than it looked, and I felt the icy slush-water crest the top of my boot and thought, No, that wouldn’t be bad at all. In fact, it would preferable to the alternative. As the cold, wet liquid seeped down and soaked my sock, it occurred to me that it might even be something to celebrate. But other days, I focus on how good it feels to put a nice warm new sock after peeling off a wet, cold one. Everything changes, and sometimes for the better. What else is there to do with our time except to try our best to enjoy it? 
That points towards hedonism when you’re young: have a second helping of pie and a third refill of your drink. But then when you get older, when you have a kid or kids, if you do that, it becomes something different. I did that and it became different for me, at least. Now the end of the world seems a little sadder. And my attitude about it is more one of, Let me not let this life-sustaining environment end on my watch.
Did you ever read Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road? It’s really good. I often think it’s the best novel written this century. (It came out in 2006.) If you have not read it, and you still plan to do so, click this silly article off your screen now and go pick up the book instead, because I’m about to talk about the end. (Of the book, I mean. I realize we’re already talking about the end of everything else.)
The Road is a post-apocalyptic novel that tells the story of a father wandering the remains of the American east coast, trying to keep his son alive while most of society has descended into rape and cannibalism and human farming. The language is extremely terse in describing an ash-blanketed black-and-white world. I don’t think there’s any mention of color at all through the first 286 pages of the book. (Someone can surely check me and correct me on that, but I’ve looked and not found any.) The dad dies in the end, but the kid is found by another family of survivors and then the story zooms backwards in time, centuries, eons, who knows how far back? And we find this:
Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens were they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
Those are the last words in the book. People often say The Road is super-depressing, but I find great joy in it. I’m flooded with a sense of peace when I read those last words. Because to me it doesn’t seem like we’re zooming backwards in time; we may well be zooming forward. 
Who knows what will come as we come closer and closer to destroying ourselves and rendering our planet uninhabitable? Who knows what will happen after the clock ticks midnight? Maybe time will go on. Maybe people will have moved on to space stations by then. Or Mars. Who knows what they’ll grow there? Who knows what they’ll find. Maybe brook trout.

Here are eight key takeaways:
Interviewer Lesley Stahl began by talking about the recent season of hurricanes, including Hurricane Michael, which devastated Florida last week, claiming at least 19 lives. She asked Trump whether he still thinks climate change was a hoax and while he said he did not think climate change was a hoax, he also told her that did not think it was man-made, or would have permanent impacts.
“I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again. I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s man-made,” said Trump.
Trump also accused scientists who say hurricanes are getting more frequent and intense because of climate change of having “a very big political agenda”.
Asked about Jamal Khashoggi, Trump said that if the attack was found to be a state-sponsored murder, there would be “severe punishment” for those involved, saying there is “something really terrible and disgusting” about murdering a reporter – a view Trump himself said people might be surprised to hear from him. But, when asked whether he would consider stopping sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Trump seemed unwilling.
“I tell you what I don’t want to do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com(panies) – I don’t want to hurt jobs. I don’t want to lose an order like that. There are other ways of punishing.”
Trump was repeatedly and expressly asked whether he would reinstate the policy of separating immigrant parents and children at the US-Mexico border, but would not give a straight answer, saying “we’re looking at a lot of things.” When pushed, Trump said: “You can’t say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.”
I will be interviewed on “60 Minutes” tonight at 7:00 P.M., after NFL game. Enjoy!
Stahl brought up Trump’s now infamous speech at a political rally in Mississippi in which he mimicked Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who testified before the Senate judiciary committee that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were both teenagers.
Trump said if he had not made that speech, “we would not have won” and defended Kavanaugh as an “extraordinary” man.
“Why did you have to make fun of her?” asked Stahl.
“I didn’t really make fun of her,” Trump replied, adding he thought Ford had been treated “with great respect” despite the fact “there are those that think she shouldn’t have”.
Trump said he suspects his defense secretary, General Jim Mattis, might be a Democrat and “could be” heading for the exit.
Responding to a question about whether Matthis was going to leave, Trump said: “It could be that he is. I think he’s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That’s Washington.”
Trump said that while he thinks he has a “great cabinet” there are some people he’s not happy with. He agreed with comments made by his wife Melania in a ABC interview last week, that there are some people in the White House who weren’t trustworthy, saying: “I’m not a baby. It’s a tough business. This is a vicious place.”
Trump reiterated his standard foreign policy views: China is bad, the EU treats the US like chumps, Trump will stick with Nato as long as other countries pay more towards it, Russia might have meddled in the US election but they’re not that bad, and he has “great chemistry” with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Trump accepted that Vladimir Putin was “probably” involved in assassinations and poisonings. As for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he believed they meddled, but China meddled, too. “And I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem,” said the president.
The tone of the interview was often tense, with Trump telling Stahl at one point “I’m president and you’re not”. While Trump was not as openly hostile to Stahl as he has been to some other journalists, he rarely let her get out a full question, before jumping in to begin his answer or contradict her, meaning the transcript makes for fairly choppy reading.
Finally, the president revealed his capacity for self-reflection and humility when Stahl asked him if there was anything he wished he hadn’t said or done in his almost two years in office.
One regret sprang quickly to mind: the press’s treatment of him.
“So when I won the presidency – the press treats me terribly – I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest.”
Stahl pressed: but is there anything you regret?
“I regret that the press treats me so badly,” he said.",850,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,0.008985507246376812,2.898550724637681e-4,2.898550724637681e-4,0.00608695652173913,0.09014492753623189,2.898550724637681e-4,0.5394202898550724,0.35391304347826086

So it is with Stage 1 climate denial and the myth that the Earth isn’t warming. It’s so persistent that it’s related to the 5th, 9th, and 49th-most popular myths in the Skeptical Science database. Climate deniers have been peddling the myth ‘no warming since [insert date]’ for over a decade.
It’s a popular myth among those who benefit from maintaining the status quo because if the problem doesn’t exist, obviously there’s no need for action to solve it. And it’s an incredibly easy argument that can be made at any time, using the telltale technique of climate denial known as cherry picking.
I created a video to illustrate this point. The key is that the Earth has natural short-term temperature oscillations caused by factors like the El Niño/La Niña cycle. El Niño events temporarily warm temperatures at the Earth’s surface, while La Niña events cause temporary surface cooling. When you combine these up-and-down cycles with a long-term human-caused global warming trend and various other noisy influences, you get a bumpy temperature rise that allows for cherry picking of periods without warming:
That’s what it looks like with artificial data. Using real global surface temperature data from NASA, I created a popular graphic called The Escalator, which has been featured the PBS documentary Climate of Doubt and used by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on the Senate floor. The video below shows The Escalator with data updated through 2016:
As The Escalator shows, we’re currently in a particularly hot period. 2014 was the hottest year on record, until 2015 broke that record, which we just broke again in 2016. This unprecedented heat has temporarily stopped the ‘no warming’ myth in its tracks, but like every zombie climate myth, it will inevitably rise again. Faux science journalists have already written fake news stories about temperatures falling between August and October 2016. 
It’s only a matter of time before ‘no warming since 2016’ stories become common. That’s because there was a strong El Niño event that ended in 2016, very similar to the event that ended in 1998. The 1998 El Niño gave birth to the “no significant warming in 18 years” myth, which until recently was a favorite argument of deniers like Ted Cruz. In fact, earlier this week the House [anti-] Science Committee Twitter trolled “climate alarmists” by arguing that in satellite data, 2016 wasn’t that much hotter than 1998.
This myth was accurately critiqued by climate scientist Carl Mears and Admiral David Titley, as documented in the video below:
Coincidentally, there was about 0.25°C global surface warming between 1998 and 2016, which is why ‘no warming’ warped into ‘no significant warming.’ However, because of the record-shattering global heat of the past three years, the myth is likely to reset its cherry picked starting point to 2016.
Between 2006 and 2014, the myth of ‘no warming since 1998’ became so pervasive on internet blogs and biased media outlets that it began to influence climate researchers. In 2015, Stephen Lewandowsky, Naomi Oreskes, and colleagues published a paper documenting what they termed “seepage” of this climate denial myth into the scientific community.
It’s true that in the years following 1998, there were a number of La Niña events and other factors that acted to temporarily dampen the human-caused global warming trend, as illustrated in the above videos. And these factors were certainly worthy of investigation by climate researchers.
However, the volume of research on the subject was a clear indication that the denier focus on the subject had seeped into the scientific community. As Lewandowsky and colleagues documented in their paper:
across all data sets, the recent change in the rate of warming constitutes a notably smaller deviation from the overall trend than were previous periods of accelerated warming.
Approximately 150 scientific papers were devoted to the slowdown, including entire special issues of the journal Nature and a discussion in the 2014 IPCC report. Similar short-term periods of accelerated warming were virtually ignored in the scientific literature. 
Moreover, the scientific community adapted the use of inaccurate phrases like “hiatus” and “pause” to describe what was simply a short-term slowdown in global surface warming. Sometimes these phrases were redefined to refer to an apparent short-term discrepancy between models and observations (now resolved), which caused widespread confusion – a clear public communications failure. 
Starting in 2008, public acceptance of global warming dipped, and has only now recovered eight years later.
In our current post-truth state, with individuals hostile to climate science and policy taking control of America’s government, we’re likely to see a resurgence of zombie climate myths in the coming years. To stop them, we have to make it socially unacceptable to resurrect long-debunked climate myths. We have to demand that our leaders accept that facts matter, and hold them accountable for disseminating myths and misinformation. Seepage and appeasement are no longer options. 
Fortunately, the scientific community is stepping up to stand up for science, evidence, and facts. To beat back the zombies, they’ll need support from the rest of the public as well.",860,0.05460992907801419,2.364066193853428e-4,2.364066193853428e-4,2.364066193853428e-4,2.364066193853428e-4,0.7803782505910166,2.364066193853428e-4,0.016784869976359338,0.03569739952718676,0.11134751773049646

The name of the ice shelf is Larsen C; it is a major extension of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and its health has implications for other ice in the region, and sea levels globally.
How do we know a portion is going to collapse? Well, scientists have been watching a major rift (crack) that has grown in the past few years, carving out a 5,000 sq km section of floating ice, nearly the size of Delaware. The speed of the crack has increased dramatically in the past few months, and it is nearly split through.
Project Midas provides frequent updates on the Larsen C shelf. You can read a summary there, which reports:
In the largest jump since January, the rift in the Larsen C Ice Shelf has grown an additional 17 km (11 miles) between May 25 and May 31 2017. This has moved the rift tip to within 13 km (8 miles) of breaking all the way through to the ice front, producing one of the largest ever recorded icebergs. The rift tip appears also to have turned significantly towards the ice front, indicating that the time of calving is probably very close.
The rift has now fully breached the zone of soft ‘suture’ ice originating at the Cole Peninsula and there appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely.
When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10% of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula. We have previously shown that the new configuration will be less stable than it was prior to the rift, and that Larsen C may eventually follow the example of its neighbor Larsen B, which disintegrated in 2002 following a similar rift-induced calving event.
 Dr Stefan Rahmstorf provided me an excellent image from his book Our Threatened Oceans. This image shows prior breakup of regions A and B (along with the location and size of part C).
Why does all this matter? Well it is important for a number of reasons. First, when an ice shelf melts or collapses, it can unpin other ice that is sitting on land, which allows it to flow more quickly into the ocean. It is this secondary effect – the loss of ice resting on land – that changes the rate of sea level rise. Loss of a major ice shelf can also activate ice that rests on bedrock topography that makes it fundamentally unstable – ice that, once moving, will move faster and faster, until a large region is afloat. 
The entire Larsen Ice shelf, which is the fourth largest in Antarctica, covers nearly 50,000 square km (20,000 square miles) according to reporting at ABC science. The ice on the land upstream of the shelf is enough to raise sea level, eventually, by 10cm. This is not, by itself, a major threat to the world’s coastlines, but it reveals the path that other, even larger areas are likely to take in the future.
Perhaps a quotation from a seminal work on Antarctic ice sheets best sums up the situation. In a 1978 paper, John Mercer from the Institute of Polar studies concluded: 
One of the warning signs that a dangerous warming trend is under way in Antarctica will be the breakup of ice shelves on both coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula, starting with the northernmost and extending gradually southward. These ice shelves should be regularly monitored by Landsat imagery. 
Why is part of the ice shelf going to break off and collapse into the ocean? Since large calving events are so rare, and since our measurements in and around ice shelves don’t go back in time far enough, it’s hard to say whether this is a natural progression, variability, or a result of human activity (or more likely a mixture of both). One reason may be human-caused warming, which has led to melting from both above and below in nearby areas and is widely accepted to have contributed to the disintegration of nearby Larsen A and Larsen B. The Western Antarctic (the parts south of the US) is warming quite quickly, faster than most of the planet. In addition, warmer waters can reach underneath the ice shelf and can melt it from below.
That being said, there are vigorous discussions within the scientific community about how much, if any of this can be attributed to humans. Some scientists think there is strong connection; others are much less sure and see little or no evidence that humans are the cause. From my vantage point, part of this relates to our limited ability to measure what’s going on, and part of this is a common sticking point of whether an absence of evidence is evidence of an absence. 
I’ve heard from multiple differing views on this very topic while preparing this post. From my research and experience in climate science as well as in many other areas of research where risk analysis and evidence are weighed, we should assume that human-caused warming is having an effect. We can measure the incredible amount of heat that is being stored in the oceans as well as the increase in temperatures that have occurred over the Western Antarctica and changes to the ocean currents in the region – there must be some implications to the health of the ice. The real question, in my mind, is how much of the effect is humans? That is something a lot more research will be required for answering.
What we are really concerned about isn’t just this breaking event that will occur quite soon. We are more concerned about the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf. Will it disintegrate when the protective shelf is gone? If it does disintegrate, will the ice up-land follow suit, and flow into the oceans thereby further increasing sea levels?
When people ask, how much will sea levels rise by 2100, my answer is “one meter”. Why do experts think this when we’ve only had a fifth of that over the past 100 years? Sea level rise is accelerating – it’s getting faster and faster as the accumulated heat from greenhouse gases takes hold. Part of the reason for the acceleration is phenomena such as ice shelf loss. It may take a while for an ice shelf to melt but when it does, the losses occur quickly.
Just a week or so after President Trump withdrew from the world’s best hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, the consequences keep stacking up. One of the unstoppable consequences of melting ice and rising seas is the inundation of coastal communities. In the US, Miami is our bellwether city. It is a large city built on the coast, and it will be devastated by rising seas. You cannot build a sea wall around Miami – the porous substrate means that water will just soak up from below. As Miami deals with a devastating one meter of sea level rise by 2100, they can thank their senator Marco Rubio along with Donald Trump. 
Marco Rubio has long argued against taking action on climate change and he has even supported anti-environmental decisions made by Trump.

“There is a big difference between the economics of climate change and the politics of climate change,” said Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change, who oversaw the landmark Paris agreement on climate change.
“Investors are seeing a tipping point in terms of climate change” and more investors are now taking the risks into account when allocating funds, she said. The growing interest of investors in low-carbon activity will, she said, determine the global response to climate change much more than the actions of Trump.
Speaking on the anniversary of Trump’s public decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and ahead of a G7 meeting where climate change will be high on the agenda, Figueres said not only businesses but also other governments were moving ahead of the US on the issue.
“The US is in a frankly un-understandable position,” she told the Guardian. “How is [withdrawing from Paris] going to strengthen the US economy? How is it going to open up new opportunities for the US when the rest of the world is becoming increasingly decarbonised?”
She pointed to the large number of US businesses and cities that had reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in low-carbon technology. “They are saying they will continue to decarbonise,” she said. “It’s very difficult when the White House is speaking in one direction and the real economy is continuing moving in a different direction.
“Is the White House going to stop this advance [by businesses]? I don’t think so.” 
Figueres had praise for the UK, which she said was leading the world in areas such as offshore wind. “In the country that saw the birth of the industrial revolution, we are seeing a new industrial revolution,” she said. Brexit was not a reason to change the UK’s determination to move to a low-carbon footing, she said, as Britain could benefit from green economic growth.
Figueres was also scathing about those who claim the world cannot now avoid warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris agreement based on scientific advice that warming above this level would cause catastrophic and irreversible changes. “To say we can’t avoid [such a future] and give up, that is irresponsible. That is completely unacceptable to me.”
She expects a key report due from the International Panel on Climate Change later this year to underline the need for urgency in cutting emissions, but said it was still possible to stave off the worst effects of warming and that the world should focus on such efforts. “I was told in 2009 it was already too late. Had we had a global framework 10 years ago, it would have been better. 20 years ago would have been better yet. 25 years ago would have been better, better, better yet.

Last year there was an average of six flooding days per area across 98 coastal areas monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) – an all-time record. More than a quarter of these locations tied or broke their records for high tide flood days, the federal agency states in a new report.
Known as “sunny day flooding”, these events swamp streets and homes with water simply from the incoming tide, without the aid of a storm. Noaa said that in 2017 areas across the US north-east and Gulf of Mexico were worst hit, with Boston, Massachusetts, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, both experiencing 22 days of flooding, while Galveston, in Texas, was soaked on 18 different days.
Noaa warned that cyclical climatic conditions during 2018 and 2019 “may result in higher than expected flood frequencies” in around half of the coastal sites it measures. 
The longer-term trend is even more certain, Noaa said, with melting glaciers, thermal expansion of sea water and altered ocean currents pushing the sea level steadily higher and causing further floods. 
“Breaking of annual flood records is to be expected next year and for decades to come as sea levels rise, and likely at an accelerated rate,” the report states. “Though year-to-year and regional variability exists, the underlying trend is quite clear: due to sea level rise, the national average frequency of high tide flooding is double what it was 30 years ago.”
The Noaa report is “comprehensive” and “clearly illustrates the increasing problems along our coastlines”, said Ben Horton, a sea level rise expert at Rutgers University. “There is flooding on all our coastlines, places where people live and work. There needs to be a national response to that.” 
Last year was marked by three high-profile hurricanes that pummelled the US, triggering flooding that resulted in dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Scientists have found that warming temperatures, driven by human activity, is making hurricanes stronger, but it is also exacerbating more chronic nuisance flooding events by pushing up the level of the ocean.
“There’s a clear upwards trend of this type of flooding,” said Andrea Dutton, a geologist at the University of Florida. “Extreme events like hurricanes may be the breaking point but this sort of frequent flooding is the taste of what is coming in the future on a permanent basis. We need to rethink our relationship with the coastline because it’s going to be retreating for the foreseeable future.”
Dutton said that south Florida, where weather forecasts in some places now come with tidal warnings, and fish are a regular sight on flooded roads, is particularly vulnerable. The low-lying region sits on porous limestone, which pushes up floodwater from underground, and many communities are unable to easily retreat because they back on to the Everglades wetlands.
“They used to get just one day a year of tidal flooding, now it’s two months of it in the fall,” she said. “Engineering can help delay things but ultimately the oceans will win. We are going to have to live with the water.”
Globally, the seas have risen by an average of nearly three inches since 1992. Parts of the US coastline are unusually prone, with Noaa forecasting last year that the oceans could swell by more than eight feet by 2100. 
Despite the risk posed to the US by sea level rise and flooding events, there is no national plan to deal with the issue, with much of the adaption work left to states and counties. The Trump administration has rescinded previous rules to build federally funded infrastructure with climate change in mind and has sought to reverse various measures aimed at taming global warming.
“We need to take this report as a warning to prepare ourselves, or we will just sit around and wait for disaster to happen,” Dutton said.",681,0.9112759643916915,2.9673590504451043e-4,2.9673590504451043e-4,0.0032640949554896144,0.01810089020771513,2.9673590504451043e-4,2.9673590504451043e-4,2.9673590504451043e-4,0.05667655786350149,0.009198813056379823

Like all Journal opinion columnists who write about climate change, Stephens has said a lot of things on the subject that could charitably be described as ignorant and wrong. Thus many Times subscribers voiced bewilderment and concern about his hiring, to which the paper’s public editor issued a rather offensive response. 
Justifying the critics, here’s how the paper announced Stephens’ first opinion column in an email alert (usually reserved for important breaking news):
TOP STORIES
In his debut as a Times Op-Ed columnist, Bret Stephens says reasonable people can be skeptical about the dangers of climate change
In his column, Stephens pooh-poohed climate change as a “modest (0.85 degrees Celsius) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880,” citing the 2014 IPCC report. However, Stephens packed three big mistakes into that single sentence. Here’s what the IPCC said (emphasis added):
The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over the period 1880 to 2012
The northern hemisphere warms faster than the global average because it has more land and less ocean than the southern hemisphere (water warms slowly), so this is an important mistake that underestimates the global temperature rise. On top of that, since 2012 we’ve seen the three hottest years on record (2014, 2015, and 2016), so even the 0.85°C warming figure is outdated (it’s now right around 1°C). 
Most importantly, the global warming we’ve experience is in no way “modest.” We’re already causing a rate of warming faster than when the Earth transitions out of an ice age, and within a few decades we could be causing the fastest climate change Earth has seen in 50 million years. The last ice age transition saw about 4°C global warming over 10,000 years; humans are on pace to cause that much warming between 1900 and 2100 – a period of just 200 years, with most of that warming happening since 1975.
Of course, how much global warming we see in the coming decades depends on how much carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere. If we take serious immediate action to cut those emissions, as the international community pledged to do under the Paris agreement, we can limit global warming to perhaps 2°C, and the climate consequences that come along with it.
But this is where Stephens’ opinions are particularly unhelpful:
Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts … Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it.
In other words, the people obstructing climate policies are justified because climate “advocates” are too mean to them, and claim too much certainty about the future.
This is of course nonsense. There is uncertainty about how much global warming and climate change we’ll see in the coming decades (climate scientists are crystal clear about this), but the biggest factor contributing to that uncertainty is human behavior – how much carbon pollution we end up dumping into the atmosphere. This is apparent from looking at the IPCC global temperature projections:
In the red ‘burn lots of fossil fuels’ (RCP8.5) scenario, we’ll see a further 3.0–5.5°C warming between now and 2100. In the blue ‘take immediate serious climate action’ (RCP2.6) scenario, we’ll see a further 0.5–1.5°C global warming by 2100. Those ranges represent uncertainties in the climate modeling, but the difference between them – which is based on how much carbon pollution we release – is bigger than the uncertainty in each scenario.
Smoking provides an apt analogy. Each time we smoke, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain – we don’t know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit – but we know we’re making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. 
Stephens’ piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer.
So far, climate change may be humanity’s greatest-ever risk management failure. The Paris climate agreement was a major step to remedy that failure, but now the Trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from it, or simply refuse to honor America’s pledges. 
There have been bipartisan bills in Congress to implement market-based solutions to the problem, but each has been blocked by the Republican Party at the behest of its fossil fuel donors. Democrats have even proposed small government, revenue-neutral solutions that would benefit the economy, but while some Republican elder statesmen support the policy, Republicans in Congress have refused to even vote on it.
In short, on climate science and policy it’s clear where the problem lies, and it’s not with the advocates. Not only does Stephens get basic facts wrong and gloss over the tremendous risks posed by climate change, but he blames partisan policy obstruction on the people who are desperately trying every possible avenue to solve the problem. The New York Times is publishing and promoting textbook hippie punching, and its readers are rightly appalled.

A number of climate realists and scientists have canceled their subscriptions to the paper in response. It’s a difficult choice because New York Times journalists do a lot of good reporting, including on climate change. Justin Gillis is practically a national treasure. In fact many of those Times journalists themselves seem unhappy about the hire and Stephens’ first opinion piece. 
""The New York Times newsroom and the New York Times opinion section are totally separate things!"" he shouted into the void
At the same time, it’s difficult to stomach paying for a paper that uses that money to hire and promote views as uninformed and harmful as Bret Stephens’, on a subject as critically important as climate change. 
Personally, I had hoped that Stephens would simply avoid the subject, but his first piece dashed those hopes much in the way that our hopes for sensible American climate policy have been dashed time and time again by those who he defends.",1129,0.05409181636726547,0.01217564870259481,0.00219560878243513,1.9960079840319363e-4,1.9960079840319363e-4,0.5750499001996009,0.04011976047904192,1.9960079840319363e-4,0.25169660678642714,0.06407185628742515

That’s because exciting sediments, full of variations and gaps, make it hard to disentangle the extinction signal from the noise of natural variability.
So you could say that James Witts, of the University of Leeds in the UK, lucked-out with an especially boring batch of sediments in Seymour Island on the Antarctic Peninsula (the part on the map that points up to South America). His study, recently published in the journal Nature Communications, catches the extinction of marine life in one of the most detailed records ever published for the end-Cretaceous. As Witts describes it:
 The sedimentology is consistently, remarkably boring. More than 1,000 meters of sandy silt and silty sand! 
It took about 4 million years to deposit that sand in a sea bed over the crucial time before, during, and after the mass extinction. In all that time fossils accumulated steadily – mollusks, sharks, corals, crustaceans, marine reptiles – until suddenly they all stopped. The sediments continued steadily accumulating, but all the Cretaceous fossils disappeared within a few meters of each other. Rare fossils disappeared sooner, common fossils disappeared later, but there’s a fossil-free gap right below the layer that marks the end of the Cretaceous.
It doesn’t look like the environmental setting over the extinction itself changed significantly, so we can discount any rapid changes in water depth having an effect on the pattern of extinction we see from the fossil record.
Then there is a layer of dead fish.
The remarkable thing about these fish is that they are mostly whole and un-scavenged, either because the usual scavengers were extinct, or because of low oxygen conditions triggered by microbe blooms in an ocean whose food web was unbalanced by the extinction:
 The anoxia story was a surprise to us. In such a shallow setting it appears unusual. I imagine a scenario like parts of the Gulf of Mexico today, with input of material from rivers driving changes in ocean oxygen on a rapid (maybe seasonal?) scale.
A final fossil find is very unlikely to be the last individual of that species that ever lived on Earth, so it’s likely that a species lived on for some time after its last fossil was preserved. Witts used statistics on how frequently fossils of a given species show up in the sediments, to predict the likely gap between fossils if the species was still alive. He found that, in all likelihood, all the last Cretaceous species continued to live until within about 30,000 to 70,000 years of the end of the Cretaceous, and plausibly even less than that. This shows that the mass extinction was geologically “fast,” rather than a drawn-out attrition of species over hundreds of thousands of years.
Ultimately, one of the problems with studies on the end-Cretaceous extinction is that we are pushing the limits of the resolution of many fossil records, as well as the proxies for environmental change.
Recent rock dating has put the Chicxulub asteroid impact at the same time as massive eruptions in India, and shows that the main eruptions were also geologically rapid. So even though Witts’ study used a combination of magnetic field reversals, strontium isotope values, and fossil population changes to tie down the dates for his sediments, each of those has an uncertainty too big for a precise match to either the impact or the eruptions. 
Also, the iridium measurements at Seymour Island used to mark the time of the asteroid impact date back to 1994, and come from a different location than Witts’ study, which may add further date uncertainty.
But dates aside, Witts’ catalogue of over 6,000 fossils shows no hint of increasing environmental stress before the extinction, despite an episode of climate warming that lasted over a million years, before cooling at the end of the Cretaceous. This is in contrast to studies elsewhere, which found signs of a deteriorating environment for a few hundred thousand years before the extinction; in Antarctica, life seems to have been boringly oblivious until the end.
In the ongoing debate over the ultimate killer of Cretaceous life, these findings support a geologically rapid cause (anything from tens of millennia to instant), rather than slowly building environmental stress:
The fact that the fossil disappearances occur directly below the interval containing the iridium anomaly suggests the link between impact and extinction is still the key to understanding the pattern we see in the fossil record. I would also argue that we still simply don’t know enough about whether the eruptions could have produced environmental change significant enough to cause the extinction.
Further twists in the dinosaur extinction story are likely as scientists analyze samples from the just-completed Chicxulub Crater Drilling Project, while others have discovered traces of volcanic mercury that link the eruptions to the extinction. Scientists are going to need more boring sediments to sort all of that out.

Speaking at a National Press Club event in Sydney, Daley said he supported the rallies on Friday, even though he might soon be the premier and responsible for ensuring children attend school.
“Education is also bigger than the classroom. It is based on life experience. That is, in part, the importance of being confident and passionate enough to form beliefs and being prepared to stand up for them,” he said.
“They don’t have a microphone or money like the big end of town. But they do have their democratic right to assembly. I support that right to protest especially when it comes to climate change and our fragile environment.
“And more importantly in this inert digital age, of acting on that belief. Of standing up and taking action for what you believe in – it is called leadership.”
Labor has sought to distinguish itself from the Coalition by promising more rapid action on climate change, including installing seven gigawatts of regional solar farms and establishing a rebate scheme to encourage households to install a further two gigawatts of rooftop solar.
Daley has also promised to review the state’s water-sharing laws that are being blamed in part for fish deaths at Menindee Lake, and to repeal the Coalition’s more liberal native vegetation laws that have allowed an increase in clearing.
He foreshadowed more announcements on the environment before the 23 March election.
Daley’s solo appearance at the press club was initially planned as a debate, but the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was unable to attend as she was campaigning in northern NSW.
Daley backed the call from his shadow treasurer, Ryan Park, for higher wages growth for the state’s 400,000 public servants, amid concerns from the Reserve Bank about sluggish wages growth nationally and community concerns about the cost of living.
Park said he would like wages growth “with a three in front of it”.
In 2011 the Coalition government introduced a 2.5% cap on annual public sector wage increases, with higher increments possible only if offset by productivity savings.
Daley said he would introduce an independent umpire, so that workers such as paramedics would be able to argue they had increased their skills and deserved a higher pay rise.
But he refused to say how much a pay rise of 3% or more would cost the state budget.
Although he has been campaigning on overdevelopment in several Sydney electorates, Daley said he would not be taking a significantly different path from the government, and would keep the Greater Sydney Commission, which sets targets for levels of new housing in each area.
However, he has promised to abolish “spot rezonings” – where developers can ask for particular sites to be rezoned – and promised to return more power to councils to ensure “fairness and certainty” in the planning system.
He said there had been political interference in the housing targets set by the Greater Sydney Commission which meant Woollahra, in Liberal heartland, has a target of only 300 new dwellings, while western Sydney has borne the brunt of accommodating new housing.",531,0.06812749003984064,0.09203187250996016,0.07211155378486056,0.04023904382470119,0.47051792828685257,0.04023904382470119,0.004382470119521913,0.09601593625498009,0.060159362549800796,0.05617529880478087

Speaking at the same time as Turnbull addressed the party faithful at the Coalition’s campaign launch, Hewson told protesters the Coalition’s lack of action on climate change was a “national disgrace”.
“I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it should have been for quite some time,” said Hewson, who was once the local member for the seat of Wentworth, which includes Double Bay.
He said “short-term politicking” from both sides left targets that were inadequate and policies that were not going to meet those targets.
“The one thing that hasn’t failed is people like yourselves,” he said. “The community is way ahead of the political leaders and the business leaders on this issue.”
He urged the crowd to push political leaders for a bipartisan approach to climate change. “Enough is enough, it’s time to act,” Hewson said.
A spokesperson from GetUp, which organised the protest in coalition with three other environment groups, estimated there were about 2000 people in the crowd.
Protesters were given placards in the shape of coral, which were coloured on one side, and white on the other, which symbolised the devastating bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. They turned them around for the cameras, while chanting “Choose the reef, not coal”.
Robert Shelly, who lives in Vaucluse, attended the protest with his two-year-old daughter, Ariella, and her dog. “We come from a family with a big environmental conscience. It’s a very important issue and it’s been completely ignored by the mainstream,” he said.
Paula Brook, who lives in Woollahra, said she was motivated to come to the protest after seeing the Australian Conservation Foundation’s scorecard, which said the Coalition’s environmental policies were “woefully inadequate”.
“The Coalition was really far down, and this is Malcolm Turnbull’s electorate and so it was important to show him that people care about environmental issues,” she said.

The crowd was also addressed by Dr Kate Charlesworth, who was until recently a Wentworth resident and previously worked at the sustainable development unit at the National Health Service in the UK. She said although climate change was a great risk to human health, and a health emergency, actions that would mitigate climate change had the potential to be a great boost to human health.
“Things like active transport – walking and cycling – improved diets with more plant based foods; looking at the causes of air pollution; reducing traffic congestion; healthier cities with more green space and tree cover. All these things will have tremendous benefits to human health,” she said.
Michael Borgas, a climate scientist at the CSIRO also addressed the crowd, calling on the government to fund climate science, following the news that the CSIRO was making significant cuts to its climate research.
Tony Fontes, a Great Barrier Reef diving instructor, also spoke, calling for stronger climate action to protect the reef. “We’ve just seen the greatest, most devastating bleaching event in the history of the reef and we’re going to see more.”
Lyndon Schneiders, the national director for the Wilderness Society, which helped organise the protest, said: “Malcolm Turnbull must do more to address climate change. The Great Barrier Reef is dying on Mr Turnbull’s watch and yet his government sticks to its inadequate Direct Action policy.”
Nikola Casule from Greenpeace – another organiser of the protest – said Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were growing and forecast to increase until 2030. “The science is clear – the world needs to stop emitting greenhouse gases but our emissions are going in the other direction.”

The protest caps three days of protesting in Turnbull’s electorate.
On Friday Greenpeace activists hung a banner from Turnbull’s electorate office in Edgecliff, saying: “Turnbull’s Legacy: bleaching – brought to you by Malcolm’s mates in the coal industry.”
And on Saturday, a group of 50 pacific islanders kayaked from Blues Point to Lady Martin’s beach, mere metres from Turnbull’s harbourside mansion, raising awareness of climate change and sea level rise.",712,0.027977839335180055,0.01966759002770083,0.04736842105263158,0.11662049861495845,0.45457063711911355,0.0030470914127423824,2.770083102493075e-4,0.20526315789473681,2.770083102493075e-4,0.12493074792243768

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 59% of Americans were already exhausted by the amount of election coverage in June, when D-day was four months away. As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the “please induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over” mark.
Here’s the thing, though – nobody is forcing us to keep talking about the elections. We don’t live in Trumpenistan yet; we are not all legally obliged to mention Donald Trump’s name in every second sentence. The democratic process does not hinge on us spending hours writing long Facebook posts explaining our views on the candidates in block capitals to echo chambers of our own opinion. We are allowed to talk about other things. In fact, ’tis the season to talk about other things: there are some autumn conversations that are obligatory. Here are five to get you started and get your mind off the election.
Every year, pumpkin-flavoured drinks, capitalism’s way of ringing in the autumn, start appearing earlier and earlier. This is not a weird sign of climate change; it’s the sign of a weird national obsession. According to Dunkin’ Donuts, “In the New York City area, pumpkin-flavoured drinks were available starting 18 August due to customer feedback that they wanted pumpkin even earlier.” However, pumpkin spice lattes – popularised by Starbucks, but now peddled everywhere – really come into their own when the temperature starts to drop, as it has in the last few days in New York. For the next couple of weeks, millions of people are going to be pulling on their Lululemons and Uggs, grabbing their first PSL of the season and exclaiming: “Ah, now I really feel like it’s autumn!” Meanwhile, millions of PSL haters are going to inform you how abominable the beverage is, to ensure you know they’re not “basic”. Pumpkin spice lattes are the 2016 election in a cup. Divisive, disgusting and everyone’s got an opinion. Dammit, we’re back to the elections.
Americans take Halloween almost as seriously as democracy. People spend weeks planning their outfits. Somewhere in the US right now, I can guarantee a group text like this is happening:
“Let’s all dress up as a sexy poop emoji or sexy Pokémon this year!”“I dunno … What do you think about the sexy breast cancer awareness costume?”“Some people might find that offensive. What about dressing up like Isis?”“No, wait, I know! Let’s go as slutty Harambe!”
Yes, there really is a sexy Harambe costume because this is 2016. And if gorilla-style politics is not for you, there’s also a sexy Donald Trump costume and a sexy Hillary Clinton costume. Who says we need to make America great again? It’s already perfect.
In New York, dating is a blood sport. When the temperature starts to drop, however, competition really hots up and “cuffing season” starts. Urban Dictionary explains that, as autumn begins, people “who would normally rather be single or promiscuous find themselves along with the rest of the world desiring to be ‘cuffed’ or tied down by a serious relationship”. Cuffing season is often accompanied by “zombieing”. This is when an ex long gone from your life rises from the dead (metaphorically speaking) and starts randomly liking your social media posts or sending you one-word texts such as “Hi”. If you go to a bar in New York during cuffing season, you will overhear long discussions about if “I should say ‘hi’ back?” (No.) You may also see already-cuffed couples in matching flannels discussing their apple-picking plans.
According to a 2015 study, almost 75 million people, about a quarter of the US population, play fantasy football, spending $4.6bn (£3.5bn) on it. Meanwhile only 9% of the US chose Trump and Clinton as the presidential nominees. Fantasy football (I’m talking about American, no-feet-involved football, obviously) is an obsessive topic of discussion around this time of year. Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed; Trump’s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can’t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is running ads on fantasy football websites, describing Trump as “like that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup”.
Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently announced that climate change has reached the “point of no return”, with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the 400-parts-per-million threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. Others will tell you that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing non-competitive. Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: “Why doesn’t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!” People have always enjoyed talking about the weather; it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone “Gosh, it’s got cold recently”, there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all.",920,0.12244389027431422,2.493765586034913e-4,0.0077306733167082295,2.493765586034913e-4,2.493765586034913e-4,0.0800498753117207,2.493765586034913e-4,2.493765586034913e-4,0.21471321695760598,0.5738154613466334

In a joint interview with his fellow crossbench senator David Leyonhjelm on the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Roberts also accused the former environment minister Greg Hunt of introducing a carbon tax and reiterated his belief there was no empirical evidence carbon dioxide caused global warming.
When asked if he were a sovereign citizen, Roberts replied: “The Australian people and the Queensland people are more interested in things like the economy and security. But I’m not a sovereign man.”
Sovereign citizens are a radical libertarian political movement spawned in the United States, the central tenet of which is to refuse to consent to laws and taxation.
In a letter to Gillard in 2011, Roberts rejected that he was bound by carbon tax legislation.
“I, Malcolm-Ieuan Roberts, the living soul am not living in a free and equal society or should pay for it in some further spurious tax levied supposedly on carbon dioxide, and believe that none exist,” it said.
On Insiders, Roberts explained he had intended to point out some issues with the carbon tax but “didn’t do my research adequately so I stepped back into the conventional approach”.
He explained he sent the letter because it appeared “the majority of the Liberal party and certainly almost all the National party ... said that they are opposed to the claims about carbon dioxide hurting our planet [but] none of them would do anything. 
“So that was the last resort. I didn’t explore it deeply enough.”
Roberts said he was “definitely not” seeking any longer to be treated differently to other Australians and agreed he would be “part of the system”. He said there was no empirical evidence showing the need to tax carbon dioxide.
In reference to the safeguards mechanism in the Direct Action policy, Roberts said: “Greg Hunt has passed through the Senate last year a carbon dioxide tax that came into effect on 1 July.”
The mechanism is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions.
Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat senator, rejected the view there was no evidence for global warming and said his party “[stays] out of the scientific debate”.
“Our view is the government shouldn’t do anything unless Brazil, Russia, India, China, US are all doing something, then little Australia should join in for trade reasons,” he said.
“But, until that occurs, it’s pointless sending our industries, making our industries uncompetitive by high electricity prices when the rest of the world is not doing the same thing.”
Both Roberts and Leyonhjelm pledged to revive the debate around section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which prohibits insulting or offensive speech based on race.
Leyonhjelm predicted a new bill would propose removing the “insult or offend” portion of the law and promised to bring his own bill to remove section 18C entirely, which, if passed, would allow humiliation and intimidation through racist speech.
“Free speech is free speech, there’s no qualification to it, you know, let’s just remove 18C entirely and everything that goes with it,” he said.
Roberts said: “It’s very important to the country ... because at the moment a lot of people are afraid to speak up.”
Asked about the impact on racial minorities, Roberts said: “The only person who decides whether I’m upset is me.” Leyonhjelm agreed, saying: “If you want to take offence, that’s your choice. 
“You have the choice of feeling another feeling. Offence is always taken, not given. If you don’t want to be offended it’s up to you, don’t be offended. We’re not responsible for the feelings of other people. None of us are.”
Roberts said the leader of One Nation, Pauline Hanson, had made clear the party’s four senators should put their constituents first and if he and Hanson disagreed with the West Australian senator Rod Culleton “we will vote accordingly”.
He said Hanson was “the best person I’ve ever worked for” and confirmed he would vote with Hanson because they both represented Queensland.
“We will be voting as a bloc but our ultimate responsibilities are to the people who are representing.”",708,3.1055900621118014e-4,0.08105590062111802,3.1055900621118014e-4,3.1055900621118014e-4,0.5065217391304347,0.11211180124223603,0.022049689440993787,3.1055900621118014e-4,0.11211180124223603,0.16490683229813666

Organizations with perverse financial incentives harass scientists with lawsuit after lawsuit, obstructing research and seeking to embarrass them with disclosures of private information.
On June 14th, an Arizona court ruled that thousands of emails from two prominent climate scientists must be turned over to the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute (E&amp;E), a group that disputes the 97% expert consensus on human-caused climate change and argues against action to confront it. E&amp;E and its attorneys are funded by Peabody Coal, Arch Coal, and Alpha Natural Resources, coal corporations with billions of dollars in revenue. 
Formerly named the American Tradition Institute, E&amp;E has been described as “filing nuisance suits to disrupt important academic research.” 
E&amp;E originally attacked Dr. Michael Mann, whose research shows a dramatic increase in recent temperatures in a graph popularly known as the “hockey stick.” In 2011, the group sued under Virginia open records laws to obtain six years of Dr. Mann’s emails from the University of Virginia—over 10,000 messages in total. The Virginia Supreme Court denied E&amp;E’s claims and ruled that academic research correspondence should be protected because release would cause “harm to university-wide research efforts, damage to faculty recruitment and retention, undermining of faculty expectations of privacy and confidentiality, and impairment of free thought and expression.” 
E&amp;E did not relent. Despite losing in Virginia, the group brought another open records case in Arizona to demand the same six years of emails—this time from Dr. Mann’s coauthor, University of Arizona professor Dr. Malcolm Hughes. Additionally, E&amp;E sued for thirteen years of emails from UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author Dr. Jonathan Overpeck, also at the University of Arizona.
In court filings, E&amp;E acknowledges it seeks emails that, in its words, “embarrass both Professors Hughes and Overpeck and the University.” These smear tactics serve no role in scientific discourse, but are an attempt to distract, disrupt, and intimidate legitimate researchers. 
E&amp;E’s attorney also claimed that female scientists may, according to him, go on “mommy sabbatical” and then ignore their publicly-funded research in lieu of “sitting around folding clothes.” Given this risk, E&amp;E argued that when scientists “abandon” their duties, emails regarding unpublished research should be released so that others can take over their work. E&amp;E did not explain how to determine what has been “abandoned.”
Just filing the lawsuit caused damage: Dr. Hughes testified it took him ten weeks to go through all the emails, and he lost an entire research summer to reviewing old emails as well as losing a grant that expired. Dr. Overpeck testified it took him six weeks to go through everything and he was unable to use his sabbatical.
These sorts of lawsuits, regardless of outcome, subtract months of labor from the scientific endeavor and cost public universities hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. 
The trial court ruled in March 2015 that the University of Arizona had provided an “abundance of supporting evidence” that releasing the emails would cause harm, and the court ruled in favor of the University. However, E&amp;E appealed, securing a rehearing in the case. 
Last month, the court reversed its earlier decision and determined instead that disclosure was warranted. The court concluded that:
[a]lternative methods of communications have been and remain available to Professors Hughes and Overpeck and any other similarly situated persons should they desire to correspond in confidence regarding research projects and like endevours [sic].
The implication seems to be that scientists’ research discussions should be limited to the telephone. 
In a modern workplace, email is critical to professional communication. This decision will force scientists to work in a fishbowl, with every email exchange—from offhand notes to highly technical analyses—picked apart by agenda-driven opponents. It will stifle candid scientific debate, discourage open collaboration, and chill free academic thought. The Union of Concerned Scientists has found that:
open records requests are increasingly being used to harass and intimidate scientists and other academic researchers, or to disrupt and delay their work.
In an ongoing federal case, the conservative group Judicial Watch—which claims climate science is a “fraud science”—has sued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for thousands of climate scientists’ emails related to a 2015 climate change study published in Science. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), who accused NOAA of having an “extreme climate change agenda,” unsuccessfully sought the same emails last year. 
In addition to the Arizona case, E&amp;E attorney Christopher Horner paired with another fossil fuel industry funded-group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, to sue for the emails of climate communications professor Dr. Edward Maibach. While Dr. Maibach sought to intervene in the litigation, the judge ruled that he lacked jurisdiction. Thousands of pages of Dr. Maibach’s emails were released, and plaintiffs posted them to the internet with quotes pulled out of context and commentary calling him and other climate researchers “frauds,” “snake oil salesman,” and worse. 
To evaluate scientific merits, a critic needs final data, methodologies, and research results—not thousands of emails. The peer review process vets research results, followed by examination and replication by the scientific community. These safeguards remain the foundation of scientific review. 
In our ongoing quest for scientific progress, every frivolous lawsuit against a scientist represents a step in the wrong direction. We must not allow groups with perverse financial incentives to jeopardize science.

A new 12-page discussion paper obtained by Guardian Australia addressing the emissions reduction architecture of the national energy guarantee (Neg) suggests the government is yet to make a decision about whether domestic or international emissions offsets are in or out.
Business has long supported the use of carbon credits as a low-cost means of reducing emissions, but the former prime minister Tony Abbott has styled himself as a fierce opponent, arguing offsets are a form of carbon trading where “Aussie consumers end up shovell­ing our money to foreign carbon traders – and we all know the ­potential for rorts there”.
Despite the lack of clarity both on the use of offsets and the treatment of Australia’s emissions intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities, the commonwealth is pushing the states and territories to sign off on further work on the Neg when energy ministers meet this Friday.
Some of the jurisdictions were surprised to learn late last week that the Turnbull government would circulate its own paper on the emissions reduction elements of the Neg in the lead-up to the meeting, in addition to technical work supplied by the Energy Security Board.
The Energy Security Board has provided all jurisdictions with a 54-page document outlining the technical design of the new scheme and the mechanisms that will be deployed under the Neg, a policy that would impose a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction requirement on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users from 2020.
The new commonwealth paper confirms the emissions reduction target for electricity in the proposed Neg will be a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, despite a new outbreak of internal restiveness on energy policy in which some Coalition backbenchers are arguing they have not signed off on that specific target.
The paper doesn’t make clear how the trajectory will be determined for emissions reduction, but it suggests the initial target will apply for 10 years, before being adjusted every five years “aligning with [the government’s] domestic policy review and refine cycle, and the five-yearly review under the Paris agreement”.
The government is not clear whether external offsets can be used by participants to help them comply with the emissions reduction obligation at least cost. It notes that some stakeholders have raised concerns about the quality of international units.
The paper says the commonwealth “is continuing to consider whether retailers should be able to use external offsets”.
“The government’s position is that if offsets were eligible, it should be in a manner that provides the greatest investment certainty, is technology neutral, helps address small compliance shortfalls and reduces market imbalances.”
The government is, however, clear that more ambitious emissions reduction activities undertaken by state and territory governments through their renewable energy schemes will not ultimately boost the federal target. Several jurisdictions have expressed concern about the Neg on the basis of the low-ball 26% cut.
The paper says: “Where states and territories pursued their own renewable energy targets, such as to achieve investment or employment policy objectives, this would not change the target under the guarantee.”
The discussion paper also makes it clear the government hasn’t yet resolved how to treat EITE activities.
The paper indicates the government is inclined to exempt EITE activities from the emissions requirement under the Neg, as it did under the renewable energy target, but the mechanism for doing it is not yet resolved.
The government has been warned by electricity generators that if retailers are able to remove EITE customers’ load from their emissions obligation, then it could unbalance the Neg. The discussion paper says the government will “carefully consider the issues raised by stakeholders in the design process”.
The chair of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, has written to all ministers urging them to come to the table on Friday. “Providing long-term policy confidence and stability is critical to lowering investment risk in the national energy market and bringing down electricity prices,” her letter says.
 Schott says the Neg will encourage investment in a least-cost portfolio of energy technologies and demand response that is both dispatchable and low-emitting.
 She says the policy is technology-neutral and insists it is not a new trading scheme. 
“The guarantee will use existing mechanisms for the purchase of electricity by market participants,” she says. “Electricity companies already buy electricity from each other to meet their requirements.”
The coming week is critical for the fate of the Neg because any single jurisdiction has the power to break the concept. Changes to the national electricity market rules require consensus between the commonwealth and the states.
While the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is confident he can get his colleagues over the line, Labor governments in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Queensland are yet to signal public support.
Federal Labor is also yet to signal bipartisan support, and is highly unlikely to sign up if it doesn’t have flexibility to increase the ambition of emissions reduction in the scheme.",831,2.3752969121140142e-4,0.10950118764845607,0.00498812351543943,2.3752969121140142e-4,0.8529691211401426,0.028741092636579573,0.002612826603325416,2.3752969121140142e-4,2.3752969121140142e-4,2.3752969121140142e-4
